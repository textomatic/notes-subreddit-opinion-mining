And I do mean a ton.  I bought and downloaded 5 yesterday, transfer was easy.  I realized I can't use the Mac App with 5.  Right?  Changes I made in 5 aren't synced to the desktop app.  Also I kept getting a syncing error in 5.  What was it syncing with?  I am going to continue to play with it but I am not sure I feel comfortable diving in yet.   \n",

       "3  I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour. I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s. Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?\\n\\nI’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm). \\n\\nCould we please have the option to revert to the old inking behaviour? :( for once I am glad that they released a completely new app because I can still use Goodnotes 4, but I have been waiting so long for vertical scrolling.    \n",

The app store description for GoodNotes 5  says \"Use one of many supported styluses (Apple Pencil included) or your finger to write like on real paper,\" which I had interpreted to mean that there would be support for the same range of third-party styluses as on GoodNotes 4. \\n\\nHas anyone managed to get GoodNotes 5 working with other styluses yet? Please let me know if I'm overlooking something!   \n",

They said that they didn’t want to delay releasing GN5, so they shipped it without those features. I strong feel as though they should have warned people in the beginning that some features were missing from GN5 but that they were planning on adding them later.

       "3  What happened to the pen (Goodnotes 5)?I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour. I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s. Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?\\n\\nI’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible.

I.e if you zig zag you’ll see ink building up at the changes of direction where the pen slowed down.\\n\\nI do agree they dialed up the velocity effect a bit high, and would be good to have a slider that can vary this (similar to Procreate brush customisation)., Yeah I’ve been playing around with it a lot and I can’t really pinpoint what exactly is the difference. They had it just perfect before, and now, they’re just like any other app.\\n\\nI used notability for about a month and I came to the conclusion that the iPad isn’t meant for extended writing, until I decided to try Goodnotes 4. That completely changed it, and I could finally say that the iPad is a complete paper replacement for me. You may have noticed that I tend to hang around /r/iPad a lot, and I have made many comments praising Goodnotes 4 for its inking, and now they took away the only feature that mattered to me in Goodnotes 5.

Do you notice it or is it just me? Why does this app that I’ve used 8-10 hours every day feel so foreign to me right now., I do agree that GN4's pen is infinitely better than Notability's pen - I use Notability to record my class tutorials and write on the slides because of its smooth, continuous vertical scrolling, but writing my revision notes is 1000% more comfortable, enjoyable, and neat on GN4. I love being able to set exactly the thickness I want, whereas with Notability the smallest is too small for me, and the second smallest is too big, for both ball point and fountain. I have no idea why, but the writing in GN4 also just feels smoother and more responsive. Don't get me wrong, I love Notability, but GN4 is just that little bit better for me.\\n\\nI have downloaded GN5 but haven't played with it yet, but I'll be very disappointed if the pen feels like Notability's, because that's one of GN4's biggest advantages over Notability for me. The other is their highlighting, since it goes under text instead of over., Please do try out the pen in Goodnotes 5 soon. I really don’t want to be the only one who’s really dissatisfied with the changes. I’m fine with staying with Goodnotes 4 for now, but I know that it won’t be kept up to date forever, and I also really want vertical scrolling. &amp;gt;.&amp;lt;, Oh I absolutely will try it, especially since the vertical scrolling is currently a very, very strong feature in Notability's favour. Worst case scenario, I end up not liking it and just continue to use both Notability and GN4. I'll give it a solid try for a week or two before I make any firm judgements, and maybe in the end if a lot of people complain about it (and many people seem to think this release was rushed), they might fix it and we'll all be happy., Yes, they did change the inking but frankly I find it much better; I agree with the suggestion to try the ball pen, Like I said, I have tried the ball pen. If I was happy with the ball pen I would have just stuck with notability because that was what I was using before I switched over. ):, The issue is that there is a decent number of people who do prefer notability’s pen, and if there are not enough people who dislike the new pen in goodnotes 5, we might never get back the old pen.\\n\\nI usually give myself one week before I make judgements, as I did for a matte screen protector review that I recently made. I just used Goodnotes 5 in lectures today and the difference is drastic. It’s just that bad (for me and my handwriting). , I’m dissatisfied with the writing in good notes 5 as well, it’s not that it makes my writing look bad, it just feels slow. Something feels off as I’m writing. I noticed that the ink fades in from the tip of the Apple Pencil rather than solidly appearing. Which is distracting. When I write a fast line, the distance between the line to the Apple Pencil is almost twice as far as it was before. It feels like writing on a 60FPS iPad instead of a 120FPS Pro Motion iPad. It isn’t bad, it just feels much worse., I noticed the lag too, but I feel that my issue is a separate one. Do you feel that the inking has changed?, Yes, the inking definitely changed, as my handwriting definitely looks different., I thought I was the only one! I came to this thread solely to look for a comment/thread like this! I also think that my Goodnotes 4 writing/pen was somewhere between 0.3mm and 0.4mm and I can't hit that sweet spot in Goodnotes 5. I've personally identified the change to be the fact that I feel like I no longer hold as much control in Goodnotes 5 as I did in 4 (in terms of the thickness of my handwriting and the speed), making it look messy overall. I will say though, after extensive notetaking I feel like I could get used to it, but it's not ideal. I guess we'll see if there's an update/change in the near future! I prefer Goodnotes 5's UI, organization so much more it's worth getting used to the pen for em!, I love all the new features too, but the new pen is truly a dealbreaker for me. I tried reaching out to them on twitter but they haven’t responded.\\n\\nI reverted to goodnotes 4 for my afternoon lectures and damn, it makes such a huge difference. , I like the effect but I think they should just make it an optional and let people decide., Disappointing.  I haven't tried 5 and probably won't if the inking is similar to Notability.  That's the reason I used 4 in the first place., So far, I like it really really more. , Then you probably also like notability’s pen (which is completely fine). The only problem is that there’s little recourse for people like me who don’t like it. , Wow finally someone that has faced the same issue. I come from Notability and just can’t stand the fade effect while writing. I mean with a regular pen there is no fade so why would they add this? Hope they fix it soon..., The same here, still using GoodNotes 4 because od that even though I would love to update. The ink in GN5 feels slow and oversensitive. Yuck. , I have a feeling people with more cursive writing tend to like the notability and this new pen more. I study chemistry and also write in print and so I prefer the old, more ball-point like pen better. I’m worried we’ll be outnumbered as well though, Yeah, probably, although I sometimes write in cursive too but I still prefer the pen in goodnotes 4. Sigh. Maybe it might be worth leaving an AppStore review to try to bring this to their attention. I have been so hyped up for goodnotes 5 too ):, Yeah I may do that. I’d love to like GN5]</td>\n",

And I do mean a ton.  I bought and downloaded 5 yesterday, transfer was easy.  I realized I can't use the Mac App with 5.  Right?  Changes I made in 5 aren't synced to the desktop app.  Also I kept getting a syncing error in 5.  What was it syncing with?  I am going to continue to play with it but I am not sure I feel comfortable diving in yet.   \n",

       "3  I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour. I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s. Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?\\n\\nI’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm). \\n\\nCould we please have the option to revert to the old inking behaviour? :( for once I am glad that they released a completely new app because I can still use Goodnotes 4, but I have been waiting so long for vertical scrolling.    \n",

The app store description for GoodNotes 5  says \"Use one of many supported styluses (Apple Pencil included) or your finger to write like on real paper,\" which I had interpreted to mean that there would be support for the same range of third-party styluses as on GoodNotes 4. \\n\\nHas anyone managed to get GoodNotes 5 working with other styluses yet? Please let me know if I'm overlooking something!   \n",

ability to sync to google drive and to download multiple files at once from google drive is gone.\\n\\n I think they need some time to cope with the new launch., Goodnotes 5 is not yet compatible with the desktop app as it says in the release notes. There will be more features added in the near future. , I haven't downloaded GN5 yet but watched a walkthrough and I did see that there's a snap option to check and uncheck, I think somewhere in pen options. Hope that helps!, That sounds a lot like what's going on, thanks!, I will probably stick to GoodNotes 4 for a while. Noticed that in GoodNotes 5 there is no easy way to export all your notes to Dropbox in PDF format. Love to have those available for my non-Apple devices (i.e. most of them).\\n\\nNot a complaint: I expect that GN 5 will mature and get more features., Am I missing something or did they significantly reduce the functionality of the bookmarks button? \\nIn goodnotes 4 I could make bookmarks in textbooks and name them, now goodnotes 5 just has them as favorites with no option to name them or change how they are viewed? \\n\\nI don't know if anyone else has noticed this or maybe found a way around this problem, but I would love to hear y'alls thoughts.]   \n",

I have been waiting!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;, Upgrade is 8,99€ (Germany) for me. Seems to be the same price as the standalone app. Is this the correct price?, They shouldn’t charge you. I just downloaded it yesterday and I’m on the German appstore. Note that it is not GoodNotes 5 that you have to download, it’s the upgrade bundle which you can get to when you view “more by this developer “, Unfortunately, they are. http://imgur.com/UJqsKhy, And you have purchased GoodNotes 4 previously? That’s weird. Try contacting them on Twitter, And you have purchased GoodNotes 4 previously? That’s weird. Try contacting them on Twitter, You can see in see in the screenshot that I already gave GoodNotes 4. Yeah, I will try contacting them directly. ]   \n",

       "3  [Have you tried the ball pen? That was the closest thing to the old inking that I noticed, which is exactly why I won't use it. There is finally a difference in how the pens write and I love it. Both the fountain and brush pens are beautiful.\\n\\nTry the ball pen., Yes, of course I have. But that disables variation in thickness completely. I liked how it behaved before. , Just for reference, this is how I usually write:\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/De23nPy\\n\\nMy handwriting is quite small and I tend to fit a lot into a single line in split screen. Disabling pressure variation makes it hideous, and the new pens even more so. I am really disappointed at the moment. , ^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)\\n\\n**https://i.imgur.com/EwW0gp6.png**\\n\\n^^[Source](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot) ^^| ^^[Why?](https://github.com/AUTplayed/imguralbumbot/blob/master/README.md) ^^| ^^[Creator](https://np.reddit.com/user/AUTplayed/) ^^| ^^[ignoreme](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=ignoreme&amp;message=ignoreme) ^^| ^^[deletthis](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=imguralbumbot&amp;subject=delet%20this&amp;message=delet%20this%20ee98pl2) , The larger variation in thickness is due to GN adding velocity and not any change in pressure settings. I.e if you zig zag you’ll see ink building up at the changes of direction where the pen slowed down.\\n\\nI do agree they dialed up the velocity effect a bit high, and would be good to have a slider that can vary this (similar to Procreate brush customisation)., Yeah I’ve been playing around with it a lot and I can’t really pinpoint what exactly is the difference. They had it just perfect before, and now, they’re just like any other app.\\n\\nI used notability for about a month and I came to the conclusion that the iPad isn’t meant for extended writing, until I decided to try Goodnotes 4. That completely changed it, and I could finally say that the iPad is a complete paper replacement for me. You may have noticed that I tend to hang around /r/iPad a lot, and I have made many comments praising Goodnotes 4 for its inking, and now they took away the only feature that mattered to me in Goodnotes 5. I am devastated right now. ):, Here's a sneak peek of /r/ipad using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/ipad/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year!\\n\\n\\#1: [So I cracked my iPad and I’m not kidding this is the replacement that they tried to give me](https://i.imgur.com/X9UQbNi.jpg) | [312 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/a9q3hx/so_i_cracked_my_ipad_and_im_not_kidding_this_is/)  \\n\\#2: [A New Approach to iPad OS](https://np.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/aby9ro/a_new_approach_to_ipad_os/)  \\n\\#3: [i think i’ve bought a fidget spinner](https://v.redd.it/y1x4bt4kazw11) | [93 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/9v3pma/i_think_ive_bought_a_fidget_spinner/)\\n\\n----\\n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/afd0dd/blacklist/), I have Goodnotes 4 and 5 side by side right now and I think that there is also a much higher delay when writing on Goodnotes 5. Do you notice it or is it just me? Why does this app that I’ve used 8-10 hours every day feel so foreign to me right now., I do agree that GN4's pen is infinitely better than Notability's pen - I use Notability to record my class tutorials and write on the slides because of its smooth, continuous vertical scrolling, but writing my revision notes is 1000% more comfortable, enjoyable, and neat on GN4. I love being able to set exactly the thickness I want, whereas with Notability the smallest is too small for me, and the second smallest is too big, for both ball point and fountain. I have no idea why, but the writing in GN4 also just feels smoother and more responsive. Don't get me wrong, I love Notability, but GN4 is just that little bit better for me.\\n\\nI have downloaded GN5 but haven't played with it yet, but I'll be very disappointed if the pen feels like Notability's, because that's one of GN4's biggest advantages over Notability for me. The other is their highlighting, since it goes under text instead of over., Please do try out the pen in Goodnotes 5 soon. I really don’t want to be the only one who’s really dissatisfied with the changes. I’m fine with staying with Goodnotes 4 for now, but I know that it won’t be kept up to date forever, and I also really want vertical scrolling. &gt;.&lt;, Oh I absolutely will try it, especially since the vertical scrolling is currently a very, very strong feature in Notability's favour. Worst case scenario, I end up not liking it and just continue to use both Notability and GN4. I'll give it a solid try for a week or two before I make any firm judgements, and maybe in the end if a lot of people complain about it (and many people seem to think this release was rushed), they might fix it and we'll all be happy., Yes, they did change the inking but frankly I find it much better; I agree with the suggestion to try the ball pen, Like I said, I have tried the ball pen. If I was happy with the ball pen I would have just stuck with notability because that was what I was using before I switched over. ):, The issue is that there is a decent number of people who do prefer notability’s pen, and if there are not enough people who dislike the new pen in goodnotes 5, we might never get back the old pen.\\n\\nI usually give myself one week before I make judgements, as I did for a matte screen protector review that I recently made. I just used Goodnotes 5 in lectures today and the difference is drastic. It’s just that bad (for me and my handwriting). , I’m dissatisfied with the writing in good notes 5 as well, it’s not that it makes my writing look bad, it just feels slow. Something feels off as I’m writing. I noticed that the ink fades in from the tip of the Apple Pencil rather than solidly appearing. Which is distracting. When I write a fast line, the distance between the line to the Apple Pencil is almost twice as far as it was before. It feels like writing on a 60FPS iPad instead of a 120FPS Pro Motion iPad. It isn’t bad, it just feels much worse., I noticed the lag too, but I feel that my issue is a separate one. Do you feel that the inking has changed?, Yes, the inking definitely changed, as my handwriting definitely looks different., I thought I was the only one! I came to this thread solely to look for a comment/thread like this! I also think that my Goodnotes 4 writing/pen was somewhere between 0.3mm and 0.4mm and I can't hit that sweet spot in Goodnotes 5. I've personally identified the change to be the fact that I feel like I no longer hold as much control in Goodnotes 5 as I did in 4 (in terms of the thickness of my handwriting and the speed), making it look messy overall. I will say though, after extensive notetaking I feel like I could get used to it, but it's not ideal. I guess we'll see if there's an update/change in the near future! I prefer Goodnotes 5's UI, organization so much more it's worth getting used to the pen for em!, I love all the new features too, but the new pen is truly a dealbreaker for me. I tried reaching out to them on twitter but they haven’t responded.\\n\\nI reverted to goodnotes 4 for my afternoon lectures and damn, it makes such a huge difference. , I like the effect but I think they should just make it an optional and let people decide., Disappointing.  I haven't tried 5 and probably won't if the inking is similar to Notability.  That's the reason I used 4 in the first place., So far, I like it really really more. , Then you probably also like notability’s pen (which is completely fine). The only problem is that there’s little recourse for people like me who don’t like it. , Wow finally someone that has faced the same issue. I come from Notability and just can’t stand the fade effect while writing. I mean with a regular pen there is no fade so why would they add this? Hope they fix it soon..., The same here, still using GoodNotes 4 because od that even though I would love to update. The ink in GN5 feels slow and oversensitive. Yuck. , I have a feeling people with more cursive writing tend to like the notability and this new pen more. I study chemistry and also write in print and so I prefer the old, more ball-point like pen better. I’m worried we’ll be outnumbered as well though, Yeah, probably, although I sometimes write in cursive too but I still prefer the pen in goodnotes 4. Sigh. Maybe it might be worth leaving an AppStore review to try to bring this to their attention. I have been so hyped up for goodnotes 5 too ):, Yeah I may do that. I’d love to like GN5]   \n",

Macstories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/goodnotes-5-the-macstories-review/), it looks like you’re out of luck unfortunately., Aw, that’s a bummer. Thanks for the quick answer!, They’re going to add it to GN5 later. For now keep using GN4 for that feature , That's good news indeed! I sort of wish I had made sure everything worked before converting my notebooks to GN5, but a new year isn't the worst time to start a set of new notebooks. , Yeah true. They said that they didn’t want to delay releasing GN5, so they shipped it without those features. I strong feel as though they should have warned people in the beginning that some features were missing from GN5 but that they were planning on adding them later. That would prevent a lot of people raging on GN thinking they had removed useful features and could have prevented things like your case. Oh well! ]   \n",

And I do mean a ton.  I bought and downloaded 5 yesterday, transfer was easy.  I realized I can't use the Mac App with 5.  Right?  Changes I made in 5 aren't synced to the desktop app.  Also I kept getting a syncing error in 5.  What was it syncing with?  I am going to continue to play with it but I am not sure I feel comfortable diving in yet. I'm getting a ton of bugs with 5 as well (snappy lines, no response at times) and for some reason the ability to sync to google drive and to download multiple files at once from google drive is gone.\\n\\n I think they need some time to cope with the new launch. Goodnotes 5 is not yet compatible with the desktop app as it says in the release notes. There will be more features added in the near future.  I haven't downloaded GN5 yet but watched a walkthrough and I did see that there's a snap option to check and uncheck, I think somewhere in pen options. Hope that helps!  \n",

Thank you. I have been waiting!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B; Upgrade is 8,99€ (Germany) for me. Seems to be the same price as the standalone app. Is this the correct price? They shouldn’t charge you. I just downloaded it yesterday and I’m on the German appstore. Note that it is not GoodNotes 5 that you have to download, it’s the upgrade bundle which you can get to when you view “more by this developer “  \n",

       "3  What happened to the pen (Goodnotes 5)? I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour. I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s. Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?\\n\\nI’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm). \\n\\nCould we please have the option to revert to the old inking behaviour? :( for once I am glad that they released a completely new app because I can still use Goodnotes 4, but I have been waiting so long for vertical scrolling.  Have you tried the ball pen? That was the closest thing to the old inking that I noticed, which is exactly why I won't use it. There is finally a difference in how the pens write and I love it. Both the fountain and brush pens are beautiful.\\n\\nTry the ball pen. Yes, of course I have. But that disables variation in thickness completely. I liked how it behaved before.  Just for reference, this is how I usually write:\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/De23nPy\\n\\nMy handwriting is quite small and I tend to fit a lot into a single line in split screen. Disabling pressure variation makes it hideous, and the new pens even more so. I am really disappointed at the moment.   \n",

I've been using a Wacom Bamboo stylus with GoodNotes 4, but Apple Pencil is the only stylus available in the GoodNotes 5 settings. The app store description for GoodNotes 5  says \"Use one of many supported styluses (Apple Pencil included) or your finger to write like on real paper,\" which I had interpreted to mean that there would be support for the same range of third-party styluses as on GoodNotes 4. \\n\\nHas anyone managed to get GoodNotes 5 working with other styluses yet? Please let me know if I'm overlooking something! According to the [review at Macstories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/goodnotes-5-the-macstories-review/), it looks like you’re out of luck unfortunately. Aw, that’s a bummer. Thanks for the quick answer! They’re going to add it to GN5 later. For now keep using GN4 for that feature   "

I've been hearing a lot about GoodNotes and since I've finally upgraded to an iPad Pro where my Pencil works well, I was wondering if it's better for me to get the GN5 bundle (the one where I pay for GN4 and download GN5 for free) or go straight to paying for GN5?\\n\\nI saw how buggy GN5 is, seeing how it's still in beta, and thought of opting out to GN4 in the meantime until the bugs are fixed. Probably a better option to go with Notability seeing as the issues still haven't been fixed months after the release... GN4 has its own issues that may or may not effect you. I’d just hard pass on the lot and look elsewhere. \\n\\nThere’s no point getting used to the workflow of a deprecated piece of software (GN4) hoping that GN5 will become usable at some point. \\n\\nGN5 not in beta though, it’s released and people have paid for it. \\n\\nNotability, Note Shelf 2 are two reasonable alternatives to investigate. There are others but those are the ones I’d recommend.  I’m a long time GN4 user and didn’t have any problems with it. GN5 has its problems, probably released too early, but they are working hard to address them. \\nGN beats Notability in the way notes are organised and the ease of creating new papers - I like notability for its ink and pens, but the key to note taking is being able to find what you previously wrote. \\nMy advice, and only mine, would be to go with GN4 and give them a month or so to resolve the bugs, they are close now</td>\n",

       "22  I haven't had GN4 and I‘m wondering if I should go with the GN5 bundle or just buy GN5 as is. Hey there! I've been hearing a lot about GoodNotes and since I've finally upgraded to an iPad Pro where my Pencil works well, I was wondering if it's better for me to get the GN5 bundle (the one where I pay for GN4 and download GN5 for free) or go straight to paying for GN5?\\n\\nI saw how buggy GN5 is, seeing how it's still in beta, and thought of opting out to GN4 in the meantime until the bugs are fixed. Probably a better option to go with Notability seeing as the issues still haven't been fixed months after the release... GN4 has its own issues that may or may not effect you. I’d just hard pass on the lot and look elsewhere. \\n\\nThere’s no point getting used to the workflow of a deprecated piece of software (GN4) hoping that GN5 will become usable at some point. \\n\\nGN5 not in beta though, it’s released and people have paid for it. \\n\\nNotability, Note Shelf 2 are two reasonable alternatives to investigate. There are others but those are the ones I’d recommend.  I’m a long time GN4 user and didn’t have any problems with it. GN5 has its problems, probably released too early, but they are working hard to address them. \\nGN beats Notability in the way notes are organised and the ease of creating new papers - I like notability for its ink and pens, but the key to note taking is being able to find what you previously wrote. \\nMy advice, and only mine, would be to go with GN4 and give them a month or so to resolve the bugs, they are close now   \n",

Meaning I write something in a custom pink and then change colors but then want to use that color again. Thanks Can be done if your have an app like Artstudio that has a colorselector tool, that way you can take a screenshot &amp; find the hex code for the color. I do this in Procreate all the time. I have a stack of color swatches and a saved pallet of all the colors I save ! Pinterest has a ton of color palettes too which I love 😄 Can you link some cool color pallets here?   \n",

I know how to add pages to outlines, but I’m wondering how to put pages into categories in the outline, like some pdfs do.\\n\\nFor instance, within chapter 1, there may be pages 1, 42, and 69. Can I make these detailed outlines for my own notebooks as well?\\n\\nThanks! I hope you get a reply, I’m wondering the same. Also have some items in an outline that I cannot edit or delete.   \n",

Wondering if there is any other method of converting written text to typed text than the copy/paste? That is rather annoying. He’s right though, mando content is a sequel meme. You start with 2 and once you use those two you can only get it back with primary kills, so if you wanna ape someone you need to get a primary kill first Ekchoti yo post ni hernu: https://www.reddit.com/r/technepal/comments/ns59a2/mobile_ra_sim_ma_imei_imsi_ra_iccid_vaneko_k_ho/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share   \n",
