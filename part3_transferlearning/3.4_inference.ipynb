The problem was lessened but not gone, so I switched the old one back since I doubt it was a nib problem. \\n\\nI fear it could be the pencil itself, or the app. \\n\\nThe inside of the old nib has a bit of black stuff in it (could be some sort of buildup) but I haven\\'t found anything to clean it out with because the hole is so small and the \"buildup\" is in [between the inner threads of the nib](https://imgur.com/gallery/aaQnCrb).', \"Yeah I understand. I'll just use the ball pen for now since there aren't any major differences (except for the bold writing part, but that isn't a dealbreaker)\"]   \n",

       "188  Highlighter behavior prior to v.5.40.30 Is there a way to user deselect the changes that have been made to the highlighter in version 5.40.30? \\n\\nThe appearance of the highlighter and dark pages has become awful. The version release notes said changes were made to make the highlight or more visible. I loved the way that the highlighter worked before on dark pages. Now it simply looks awful. I just wanted the strokes to be highlighted not the surrounding area on the page.\\n\\nThe before version colored only the strokes\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TmE0UHr.jpg\\n\\n\\nThe after version (most recent update) puts the highlight over the text and also colors the area surrounding the text.\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8l8hFHs.jpg\\n\\n(Pls ignore my terrible handwriting....😬) That’s just not what the highlighter was supposed to do. You can still do this though, just circle the strokes you want to change with the lasso tool and recollect them. The effect would take a second longer but would have the same impact.   \n",

If this app had more brushes and pens and a pencil like the notes app it would be so good.. is there a way to get a pencil added? I don't think so, but it would be so helpful, also different kind of lines, like dotted or dashed( I'm a physics student and I'd love that) This!   \n",
