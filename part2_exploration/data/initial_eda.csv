Thx",Revolutionary-Win-51,"Vaccines aren’t all the same and this is the first large scale rollout of vaccines using the ChAdOx1 platform and mRNA in humans. So comparing mixing COVID vaccines with say nonavalent and bivalent HPV vaccines isn’t really relevant given the novelty of the COVID vaccines.

And while other countries are mixing we should remember that some of the countries you mentioned also put a halt to the AZ vaccine because of concern for blood clot risk while we ignored their precautions. So it’s a bit disingenuous to point to them as examples of us being on the right track when months ago we were ignoring their concerns and being told there was no risk of blood clots.

I agree we should give people the choice but the government should also be upfront about the unknowns and not try to paint a picture of false confidence. I mean they are trying to use preliminary results from two unpublished studies as support for this approach, that is laughable. Giving people the choice without the information to assess risks isn’t really giving them the ability to make an informed choice. They’re posing it as a “do you want Coke and/or Pepsi, there really isn’t a difference and it’s just up to your personal tastes.”

It’s obvious from COVID that the general public lacks the understanding of fundamental concepts relevant to disease and disease control so they must also be given open and transparent information about the vaccines.

So comparing mixing COVID vaccines with say nonavalent and bivalent HPV vaccines isn’t really relevant given the novelty of the COVID vaccines.

And while other countries are mixing we should remember that some of the countries you mentioned also put a halt to the AZ vaccine because of concern for blood clot risk while we ignored their precautions. So it’s a bit disingenuous to point to them as examples of us being on the right track when months ago we were ignoring their concerns and being told there was no risk of blood clots.

I agree we should give people the choice but the government should also be upfront about the unknowns and not try to paint a picture of false confidence. I mean they are trying to use preliminary results from two unpublished studies as support for this approach, that is laughable. Giving people the choice without the information to assess risks isn’t really giving them the ability to make an informed choice. They’re posing it as a “do you want Coke and/or Pepsi, there really isn’t a difference and it’s just up to your personal tastes.”

I get that in this situation a lot is going on. The cop is stressed and likely afraid for her own safety to some degree and her adrenaline is high. I can even see how, in the moment, she could mistake her shot for the suspect shooting. But once the scene is cleared, and things have calmed down and she can see things rationally, there's no way that she, or the other cops involved, could have simply ""not realized"" that she was the one that shot her partner. That means that she and the other cops involved all reported that the suspect initially shot. They all reported it in a way that made her fatal shooting justified, and to cast the suspect in a worse light. That is literally a cover up. 

Yes, she made a mistake, but she still tried to cover up that mistake. There can be an ongoing investigation and a cover up simultaneously.

You're absolutely right that resisting arrest is not the best thing to do. And that resisting arrest is much more likely to result in you getting injured or killed. But that doesn't make it okay for cops to kill people when they resist arrest. 


And, as far as ""POC crap"" there is statistical evidence to prove that people of color, particularly black people, are killed by police at a much higher rate. Here's a study by Harvard.

bn8vce,5,Thoughts so far about GoodNotes 5,,"Over the last few years I have jumped between GoodNotes, NoteShelf and real note books. Until now. I think this new version of GoodNotes, especially when the new version rolls out for the Mac, is just about spot on.

The writing isn’t quite as smooth as one or two other apps I have used on the iPad Pro but it’s acceptable. The feature set is getting better all the time and having the tabs at the top combined with a quick drop down list and a full document library view, it has so many excellent user friendly features.

So why not 5 stars in the Apple App Store?

It’s almost perfect but few things in life are truly perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Like wouldn’t it be great to be able to hide the tool bar while writing if we wanted to? I’d also like to have smoother writing (Noteshelf and even Microsoft’s OneDrive app write smoother). I’d also like to be able to customise the toolset to have what I regularly use in the order I want them (I never use shapes, photos or camera so I’d love to replace those icons with more quick access pen colours, for example).

So, for now, it’s a 4. Well, maybe a 4.5 really but that’s not an option in the App Store, unfortunately. 😀

Not to mention that every time an update is released, they're updating shit that doesn't matter or whatever bug they're claiming to fix doesn't actually get resolved. The developers have severely disappointed a large portion of their loyal followers and they aren't doing much to make us feel better. So that's probably why it doesn't have 5 stars in the Apple App Store.",1518,279
bn8vce,5,Thoughts so far about GoodNotes 5,,"Over the last few years I have jumped between GoodNotes, NoteShelf and real note books. Until now. I think this new version of GoodNotes, especially when the new version rolls out for the Mac, is just about spot on.

The writing isn’t quite as smooth as one or two other apps I have used on the iPad Pro but it’s acceptable. The feature set is getting better all the time and having the tabs at the top combined with a quick drop down list and a full document library view, it has so many excellent user friendly features.

So why not 5 stars in the Apple App Store?

It’s almost perfect but few things in life are truly perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Like wouldn’t it be great to be able to hide the tool bar while writing if we wanted to? I’d also like to have smoother writing (Noteshelf and even Microsoft’s OneDrive app write smoother). I’d also like to be able to customise the toolset to have what I regularly use in the order I want them (I never use shapes, photos or camera so I’d love to replace those icons with more quick access pen colours, for example).

So, for now, it’s a 4. Well, maybe a 4.5 really but that’s not an option in the App Store, unfortunately. 😀

Martin",rlmasn,"Terrible performance/speed in GN5.  I think they switched to a monolithic sql database and it slows down dramatically as notebooks get larger.  With 50-100 pages of handwritten notes it becomes much slower.

GN5 doesn't cache page images, it re-renders a page even when nothing on the page has changed.   If I am writing on page 75, the first 74 are not likely to change, so they should have been cached as images rather than re-rendering all pen strokes each time I look at them.  Slow scrolling.

The Zoom window lacks tools to switch colors and they say they aren't going to bring them back.  It is so inefficient dragging your hand to the top toolbar to switch colors (and putting the toolbar at the bottom is a nuisance).  Cut and paste and many other things can't be performed within the zoom, it must be closed and re-opened to do simple things.

Repeatedly clicking things is inefficient.    Time wasted playing around with the software interface rather than getting things done!

Another example is converting handwriting to text. It is much easier in Noteshelf 2.   Unfortunately Noteshelf doesn't have vertical scrolling.

The developers just don't seem to ""get it"" anymore, and this is 5 or 6 months after GN5 release.

bn8vce,5,Thoughts so far about GoodNotes 5,,"Over the last few years I have jumped between GoodNotes, NoteShelf and real note books. Until now. I think this new version of GoodNotes, especially when the new version rolls out for the Mac, is just about spot on.

The writing isn’t quite as smooth as one or two other apps I have used on the iPad Pro but it’s acceptable. The feature set is getting better all the time and having the tabs at the top combined with a quick drop down list and a full document library view, it has so many excellent user friendly features.

So why not 5 stars in the Apple App Store?

It’s almost perfect but few things in life are truly perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Like wouldn’t it be great to be able to hide the tool bar while writing if we wanted to? I’d also like to have smoother writing (Noteshelf and even Microsoft’s OneDrive app write smoother). I’d also like to be able to customise the toolset to have what I regularly use in the order I want them (I never use shapes, photos or camera so I’d love to replace those icons with more quick access pen colours, for example).

So, for now, it’s a 4. Well, maybe a 4.5 really but that’s not an option in the App Store, unfortunately. 😀

Thank you GoodNotes team for continuing to develop this great app.

I used Goodnotes 4 for a long time. I tried them all - GN4 was top of the pack. The best handwriting engine. The best PDF and template handling. The best bookmark handline. Switching context to read-only to use embedded links in a PDF was a bit of a pain, but worth dealing with as everything else was great.

I was excited for GN5. On launch day I ponied up the upgrade fee and downloaded it, eager to see the improvements.

And then I used it.

Bookmarks were non-existent at launch. And, when reimplemented, it was done so in a way that was a step back from what we had in GN4.

The ink engine was, and still is, a step back. At launch it was buggy and inconsistent. It's got better, but it's still a long way from where it was.

The bookmarks implementation added post-launch is awful compared to what we had before. I use this a lot so I have to keep coming back to it. Existing PDF bookmarks have been reinstated with inscrutable, uneditable, unchangeable names. The recommendation from GN Support was ""Speak to the orginal PDF author."" I am the original PDF author. The bookmarks look fine everywhere else.

So when I say ""fix it by moving to Noability"" it is not a flippant ""my thing is nicer than your thing"". GN5 is still a buggy mess. You only have to look at the posts in this sub to see that.

It crashes within 5 seconds of opening.  Every.  Fucking. Time.  The 5.2.2 update a few days later has not solved the problem.  I’ve reached out to GN and they suggest I uninstall and reinstall (I’ve done this a few times), or remove iPadOS beta from my device and run ios12, which I *really* don’t want to do since I use some of theiPadOS features.  I’ve resorted to using GN5 on my phone (not ideal) and the GN5 beta for Catalina on my MacBook Pro , but GN5 Catalina has a few bugs that make using it a bit of a challenge.  I’m not seeing any other users complaining about the crashing issue on any of the GN forums I’ve checked, so ,maybe it’s  just me?  This is really fucking with my productivity since I use GN for everything from managing daily tasks to annotating PDFs.

detyts,1,What's the best way of exporting GN notes to Onenote?,,"Even though I organize work, personal life and studies on Onenote, I still feel like GoodNote is the best note taking app
However I'd like to know if you have any suggestion on how it would be best to export my GN notes to Onenote and also having the possibility to convert handwritten to text.
I would like to write my meeting minutes on GN and then share the Onenote file for the outlook meeting.
Is the best way to first convert the notes on GN to text and then copy the text manually to Onenote?

df0hmz,3,Letters shrinking on GN5,Question - iPad,"saw a comment from another user in one of the posts that said ""for some reason my strokes are always shortened. They kind of shrink back??"" 

i experience the same thing as well and it's incredibly annoying. like if i write a d, the last stroke will kinda shrink and it'll look sort of like an a instead.

i prefer the features on goodnotes but this issue is why i'm using notability instead. wondering if anybody else experiences the same thing or knows if there's a way to fix it?",moegnus,Are you using the ball pen or fountain pen?,1570573163,Are you using the ball pen or fountain pen?,43,9

If you wanted to go for realistic representation, obviously you could just make all the characters whatever you wanted 🤷

As you know, each photon cannot violate the speed limit. If I shoot two photons in opposite directions and they hit something at the same time, the photon did not just teleport.

None of this violates physics, requires extra dimensions, or is relevant to the behaviour of a large physical object moving in 3D space.

The original point of this thread was that if its a 4D object moving in 3D space it might explain the unusual behaviour like moving very fast or turning very fast.

Other than that and the auto backup feature which will be added soon, GN is great.

its clean &amp; neat. the highlighter is a delight, the pencil styles, papers are just a better experience in GN.",688,122
dvf2d8,1,Goodnotes for lectures,Question - iPad,"Hi!

I just got my iPad, and I wanted to download a note taking app. 
The two main options are Goodnotes and Notability. 

I’m intrigued much more by Goodnotes, but there is the audio recording feature of Notability which would be incredibly useful for classes (I’m attending university). 

Can anyone share their experience regarding this? What app do you use? 
How is your experience with Goodnotes?

Thank you!",ksj96,"I use Goodnotes on my iPad for lectures. I also have it on my MacBook!
Goodnotes has been so amazing. Since it’s on your iPad you’re much more motivated to take notes and to study. I bought my iPad shortly before midterms and I used Goodnotes to study for them. I’ve never had such good grades in university! Goodnotes is my personal favourite, I like the interface much more and the easiness of it. Such an amazing tool! However, if you have to draw shapes a lot, Goodnotes isn’t the best for it. Circles are fine but other shapes are a bit tricky. All in all you won’t regret buying your iPad :)",1573594493,"I use Goodnotes on my iPad for lectures. I also have it on my MacBook!

e2m2ao,1,Some suggestions and improvements for Goodnotes 5,,"Hi there

I have had GN5 installed on my iPad for a while now, and have come across some things that could be improved

1) The app seems kind of slow and laggy when scrolling through documents, especially if there is a fair bit written on a page

2) Writing occasionally disappears and then reappears

3) The colour code doesn't show the one of the colour currently selected. It always shows FFEEFF

4) Squared paper isn't sized how it should be compared to actual paper. On real paper you have squares that are 5mm wide and tall. The closest I have seen is the ""squared paper"" template, with 5,75mm intervals

5) Pen sizes in GN4 and GN5 use different systems. A ""1"" in GN4 is approximately a ""0,2mm"" in GN5, while a text marker ""10"" in GN4 is a ""2mm"" in GN5. Am i correct in assuming a 1=0.2 ratio?

Thank you.",lorlwrnc91,"One thing I can’t stand about Good Notes (and every other note taking app except for Apple Notes) is that there isn’t an option for a pencil that fully functions like an actual pencil. Good Notes doesn’t even have a pencil, and Notability has one but it doesn’t act much like a pencil but more like the ball point pen in Good Notes. I like the pencil to be pressure sensitive (I mean really really pressure sensitive), and I like it to look and shade like a real pencil. I don’t think that will EVER happen.

It annoys me, because I like certain things about each of the note taking apps, and I wish they’d make an app with all of it combined into one. I’ll start to think that I really really like a note taking app, and then one little thing will throw me so off that it disgusts me. Lol. I guess the cons outweigh the pros is what I’m trying to say, and it is very bothersome. I believe there are a lot of issues with copyright, and so that’s why they don’t all have the same features.

I really like Apple Notes, but when I go to put my palm on the screen it goes crazy, highlights everything I’ve written, and if I’m not careful I’ll accidentally hit delete. You can undo it now, but think about how horrific it was when you couldn’t retrieve all of the notes that just took you hours to write!!!!!

Good Notes feels very basic to me. I’m not sure why, but it’s just like their tools are very basic. There is pressure sensitivity on the pens, but its finicky. It only want’s to do a basic stroke instead of a real time pressure sensitive one (if you know what I mean). The shape section is so annoying to me too. I can’t actually insert a shape from a drop down menu (if I can I haven’t seen how to yet), and I think it’s kind of strange that you have to draw the shape. It takes a million tries to get it perfect and the way you want it to be. You can’t resize it after it’s done. Then stuff with files, drag and drop, etc.There are so many little things that nag at me, but that’s a few of them.

1. I've never seen this -- could be because of the iPad I'm using. I've noticed lag on my iPad mini 4 occasionally, but... I've not seen what you're talking about, more that sometimes the screen will be blank for a bit before rendering. But that is an older iPad.
2. I have never seen this. I've handwritten more than a thousand pages. What model iPad are you using? I think that might be the difference.
3. I've never seen this, Trying it now I can't get that to happen.
4. Goodnotes is a little frustrating in this way. It \*always\* scales the paper to fit in on the screen so you're basically never seeing the paper at 100% zoom. It is always larger or smaller than 100%. The only way around this is to make your own templates that are carefully measured to exactly match the editable screen size on your device. I've done this for the iPad 11 Pro with the Graphics app. It's not that hard to to do but it isn't easy. I agree that this is frustrating. At the very least they should put a 100% zoom control somewhere so that you can get things properly sized regardless of paper size.
5. I don't understand what you are saying, but I suspect that you're seeing something similar to #4 but regarding pen diameter. The pen diameter is dependent on how zoomed the current document is. A 2mm pen will only appear to be 2mm if the doc is at 100% zoom, which is problematic (see #4.) This too can be fixed by making your own templates and always using them: you will have consistent pen width. Otherwise as you switch between different page sizes the pen will seem thicker and finer, which is confusing.

They have been promising the voice recording feature for way longer than 2 years fyi and theres no sign or even indication of progress being made.

To this day , the most important feature of auto back up to other cloud services aside from icloud has still not been implemented yet so I doubt voice recording will ever be implemented.

Is anyone has the same issue? How can we fix this?",Taafr3535,"Pardon the length, wanted to make sure my numbers were right. The reference to the $400k is a perfect example in that it is extreme, and it wasn't just top leadership. The highest paid officer WAS patrol and he made $414,543.06 (in 2019). It's not a dishonest argument and it is all publicly available data. The fact that this was even possible and that there isn't a system in place to prevent this is unacceptable. Do you honestly think otherwise? I hope you never complain about taxes ;)  The Seattle Times said ""For example, the median for officers who worked at least 1,000 hours was $167,000."" The avg working year is 2000 hours, so that means there are a lot of officers who make over $167k with full benefits and taxpayer backed pensions. A Forbes report from last year states that the avg US salary for a police officer is $67,600. So Seattle officers, on AVERAGE, are paid $100,000 dollars more per year. I openly acknowledge there are additional considerations such as cost of living but there is no angle in which someone can argue in good faith that these officers are not well compensated. They should be well compensated but within reason and competitively.

Now, my opinion is that the officers are leaving because they don't feel respected or appreciated. They are here to serve the community and right now that community is critical of them. Instead of taking stock of what truths may exist and how to bridge that gap, there has been some outright rejection of service to the community. It's basically a threat, accept us as we are no matter what we do or we may just stand by and let your community deteriorate. If a group has the power to legally take a life on behalf of the community, that community should absolutely hold that group to a very high standard. That is why they do deserve to be paid well. Same as why we hold medical professionals to a higher standard. When a job includes having people's lives in your hands it is very important that they get it right, every single time.

As for the de-fund police argument, it's a slogan, it's meant to be provocative. If calm normal community conversation provided the solutions people were seeking, that slogan may not have been so prevalent. My point stands that in the light of day, the average person wants more focus on mental health resources being the first responders (in applicable scenarios) to manage the response in a different way. If funding is the reason we can't have it, then a natural place to make adjustments is from what it would be replacing. That slogan was meant to force a conversation and it did. Sadly real change can't happen without some friction and forced uncomfortable conversations.

The same folks arguing all protesters are rioters are often the ones saying one bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch when it comes to police. I agree with that. But what we have seen again and again (nationally) is the blue wall and that police will back those bad apples to the bitter end. The bad apples aren't even fired in most cases, let alone held accountable to their community. That's a choice and if they choose to stand together then they should expect to fall together in the eyes of the community. The discomfort they feel is meant to inspire them to adjust that mentality, not abandon their responsibilities in retaliation. Neither plan has worked and no one is happy so maybe it makes sense to reset the table and people on both sides to start to show up with solutions instead of knee-jerk defensiveness and raw hostility. Or....we can stay entrenched in our corners and echo-chambers and at least we will all be ""right"" even if everything falls apart because of it.",1622868778,"Pardon the length, wanted to make sure my numbers were right.

 In 2018, I went to a Korean restaurant and they had a TV that played kpop mvs. After I ordered my food, it started playing hide and seek. I remember liking the song but I didn't know the group name. Then it played breathless, confession, baby and then crazy sexy cool. I found out their name through csc but I didn't know all the mvs I had watched were from the same group. It continued and played always you afterwards. My parents were talking about how handsome they were lol.  I was planning on googling astro after I got home (I didn't have data at the time) but I went home really late that day and forgot the name.

 My mum was watching koms and it happened to be sanha's episode. Once again, my parents talked about how good his voice was. I thought it was nice and relaxing but I wasn't interested in kpop at the time so I wasn't paying much attention to the show. After sanha introduced himself as part of astro, I got hit with deja vu. I couldn't remember where I heard that name before so I dropped it. 

One day my mum was looking through dramas to watch but got distracted with something so she left the TV on the drama selecting screen. Idk how else to phrase that lol. I saw my id is gangnam beauty and saw eunwoo on the front. He looked so familiar to me but I still didn't remember where I saw him. Once again, I dropped it.

I was starting to get interested in kpop in 2019. Not enough to stan any groups. Just to listen to a couple title tracks and watch a couple kpop related videos. I watched a compilation of mvs. Still don't remember what the title was but I skipped through the video and ended up watching a part of all night. It was the choreography scene and I only watched a tiny bit of it. Saw the name astro, thought it looked familiar but once again, I didn't bother looking into it.

Saw Rocky's mask inspired dance in my recommended for days. Finally clicked on it and watched a bit of it. Wasn't into watching dancing at the time but he somehow managed to make me watch it. Afterwards, I slowly started watching dance videos. Rocky's magic honestly.

Was watching some kpop video. Honestly don't remember what I was about when I read a comment that said astro's eunwoo was friends with bts. Also read about that in some article.

Then I stumbled across the poster for true beauty's drama. I was a webtoon reader and my favourite character was suho. I saw the poster and immediately thought he looked familiar but I still didn't know where I had seen him. I wasn't into kdramas at the time so I didn't bother watching it. 

Then I found a true beauty interview in my recommended while I was using YouTube. I watched it because I was curious and they had a question on astro. Found it familiar again and this time, I finally gave in and looked them up. Watched the all night performance video thinking it was the mv. I'm stupid I know. Then I watched their reaction to it and absolutely fell for the chaos. Also realised I didn't watch the mv. So I watched the mv, loved the aesthetics. Watched their pool party video then found a link to the cicada video in the comment section. Subscribed to their YouTube channel immediately and watched the videos YouTube would recommend to me. 

I watched all their mvs and wondered why most of their songs/mvs were so familiar. Then I made the connection one day. Don't know why it took me so long honestly. The more I got into them, the more I realised I missed so many chances to become an aroha earlier. But I guess it's fate. I finally became one after the universe kept shoving them at me.",1622868826,"Long story.

 My mum was watching koms and it happened to be sanha's episode. Once again, my parents talked about how good his voice was. I thought it was nice and relaxing but I wasn't interested in kpop at the time so I wasn't paying much attention to the show. After sanha introduced himself as part of astro, I got hit with deja vu. I couldn't remember where I heard that name before so I dropped it. 

One day my mum was looking through dramas to watch but got distracted with something so she left the TV on the drama selecting screen. Idk how else to phrase that lol. I saw my id is gangnam beauty and saw eunwoo on the front. He looked so familiar to me but I still didn't remember where I saw him. Once again, I dropped it.

I was starting to get interested in kpop in 2019. Not enough to stan any groups. Just to listen to a couple title tracks and watch a couple kpop related videos. I watched a compilation of mvs. Still don't remember what the title was but I skipped through the video and ended up watching a part of all night. It was the choreography scene and I only watched a tiny bit of it. Saw the name astro, thought it looked familiar but once again, I didn't bother looking into it.

Saw Rocky's mask inspired dance in my recommended for days. Finally clicked on it and watched a bit of it. Wasn't into watching dancing at the time but he somehow managed to make me watch it. Afterwards, I slowly started watching dance videos. Rocky's magic honestly.

Was watching some kpop video. Honestly don't remember what I was about when I read a comment that said astro's eunwoo was friends with bts. Also read about that in some article.

Then I stumbled across the poster for true beauty's drama. I was a webtoon reader and my favourite character was suho. I saw the poster and immediately thought he looked familiar but I still didn't know where I had seen him. I wasn't into kdramas at the time so I didn't bother watching it. 

Then I found a true beauty interview in my recommended while I was using YouTube. I watched it because I was curious and they had a question on astro. Found it familiar again and this time, I finally gave in and looked them up. Watched the all night performance video thinking it was the mv. I'm stupid I know. Then I watched their reaction to it and absolutely fell for the chaos. Also realised I didn't watch the mv. So I watched the mv, loved the aesthetics. Watched their pool party video then found a link to the cicada video in the comment section. Subscribed to their YouTube channel immediately and watched the videos YouTube would recommend to me. 

I watched all their mvs and wondered why most of their songs/mvs were so familiar. Then I made the connection one day. Don't know why it took me so long honestly. The more I got into them, the more I realised I missed so many chances to become an aroha earlier. But I guess it's fate. I finally became one after the universe kept shoving them at me.",3578,670

I feel like I've been hearing about them in late 2017/early 2018.  
The game has extremely poor development pace in regards to core gameplay mechanics.   

I'm having an impression the only thing that truly evolved since then is the meta game. By meta i'm not meaning as in people min-maxing, but the non-raid gameplay - the menu part - flea market, hideout.



Now lets think how well BSG/Nikita were realizing his vision of realistic game so far:

- They listened to community and increased armor values of helmets to unrealistic values
- They listened to community and increased armor values of face shields to unrealistic values
- They listened to community and introduced new fake ammo types for each gun to counter the fake armor
- They listened to community and introduced a surgery kit - now you can fix all the mistakes you made during raid in 15s!
- They did nothing about mag-dump meta
- They did nothing about ADAD

These are the most glaring things, I don't want to even bother listing all the small stuff.

Not a single system was evolved since 2017.  
He must be truly having a ""vision"" for the game. On podcasts, because not in his actions.  
If only they did *something*, I would shut the fuck up and wait patiently. But I'm just getting nothing but negative signals and at this point I'm disgruntled customer who's feeling cheated.",1622868877,"&gt; hitboxes for what feels like forever (1.5 years since announced?)

But is there a way to export an entire notebook at once into text using this app? The only options I see are as a PDF, GoodNotes, or an image. This may be really easy, but I’m kinda bad at learning how to use new apps when I get ahold of them.

Thank guys!",xTWISTED_WAYZx,Plus during the pandemic when id drive most people caught on to the scheduled trips actually getting them picked up sooner than not scheduled.  You could spin that scheduled trips list like it was the big wheel on price is right... just countless trips.  Every single pickup was a scheduled trip. Best part was the dam entire city would be all covered with the demand and bonus areas graphics and not a single scheduled trip would net you a bonus or surge.  No clue why but its was lame lol.  Yes tons of rides and one after another but no bonus trips or anything.  Flip on uber and no requests ... hmm 🧐,1622868975,Plus during the pandemic when id drive most people caught on to the scheduled trips actually getting them picked up sooner than not scheduled.

f96ddj,1,Apple pencil switching issues,,"My setup: iPad Pro 12.9” w/ Apple Pencil 2nd Generation

Does anyone have issues when they double tap their Apple Pencil to switch between the pen and the eraser in GN5 and it lags?

Example: You are writing something with the pen, you double tap the apple pencil to select the eraser. When you go to erase, the pen is still selected so you end up writing instead of erasing. When you lift the pencil, GN5 correctly selects the eraser and you can erase like normal. 

I don’t recall having this issue in Noteability, so I don’t believe it is a bug in iOS.

Along the same lines, is there any way to adjust the double tap speed so that GN5 doesn’t pick up false positives? Or in other words, is there a way to set the double tap speed really high so that it doesn’t switch on accident as often as it does?",duckslayr,Almost a daily occurrence for me,1582730905,Almost a daily occurrence for me,32,6

fsm63y,1,Goodnotes 5 is falling behind Noteshelf 2 on a crucial feature.,,"I love Goodnotes 5. I think it’s powerful and very good in giving people the ability to organize notes and offering the templates people can use in their everyday needs. But there is one small feature that a rival note taking app has that I hope the developer for Goodnotes looks at seriously for improvement. Noteshelf 2 is another handwriting app which in my opinion is quietly gaining on the big 2 - Goodnotes and Notability especially because it’s introduced a handy little feature people are ignoring  - giving people the ability to adjust the line spacing while writing handwritten notes.

You might smirk and sneer at this but if you are using blank paper templates with no lines when jotting down notes - you wouldn’t laugh when looking back on your own writing and seeing your handwritten notes veering off wildly downward or upwards slanted in such a way you might lose track of your own train of thought. Well, Noteshelf 2 has Goodnotes by the shorthairs on this one because the developer was clever enough to foresee this issue and introduced the line adjustment feature built into its zoom box writing utility. Noteshelf 2 lets you see the line you’re writing on in the zoom box so wherever you’re actually writing on the page you simply write your sentence on the given line in the zoom box. This allows you to always write your notes in a straight line even on blank paper with no lines. Not only that but Noteshelf 2 lets the user adjust the spacing of the line so this way you can squeeze the notes you write onto smaller surface areas when dropping down to the next line. 

Goodnotes only gives the user a simple zoom box magnification mode letting you write in the box. But this doesn’t prevent you from veering off course if you write on unlined paper. This is the one area I hope the developer of Goodnotes looks into and copies Noteshelf 2’s clever feature to make it possible for people to write sentences in straight lines on unlined blank paper. Just my two cents.",dijon360,"Agree.  You know, I've never understood why folks only ask about Goodnotes/Notability when Noteshelf 2 is on par and in some ways superior to both.  Perhaps it depends on workflow, but I get on so much better with Noteshelf than I did Goodnotes 5 or notability.",1586458438,"Agree.

fv4ur3,1,Is there an efficient way to paste to iPad from pdf on Mac?,,"I have the pdf on my mac and GoodNotes 5 open on my iPad. I can copy a photo from the pdf on my Mac, but I can't figure out an easy way to paste it to my iPad app. I could save the image as a photo to my Files app or Photos app and then upload from there but I'd rather avoid that whole process completely. Simply holding down for a second and clicking ""paste"" didn't work either.

Suggestions?",qcametti,"I tend to use screenshots and then croping the photos. I use Windows and screenshots are stored in a folder which I allow access to anyone on my network. This way I have the files app connected to my PC and I can access the photos without them really being in my iPad. Once in a while I delete the whole folder where these images or screenshots are located in my computer.

I use GoodNotes in full screen and the files app floating hidden on the right. When I have to paste an image from the PC I slide to the left from the right side of the screen to show the files app and then I drag n drop the image. The photo is in GoodNotes in less than three seconds.

I may seem a little bit tricky but once it's set up, it works perfectly and saves me a lot of time. Specially during virtual classes.

I don't know if Macs have the option to share like this by default. If it doesn't, then you can try setting up your computer as a samba server. I've done this in Linux and it works the same way. There are really good guides on how to set this up.

But the problem at the moment is, that Catalyst Apps that got submitted to Apple using a version of Xcode before 11.4 had there own bundle ID. And universal purchase is only available for apps using the same IDs. Therefore GoodNotes can’t offer a universal purchase jet. 

And in ATP they sad that switching the bundle ID isn’t all that simple.

I have no way of knowing.,dorothyfan1,Nothing specific. But there is a badly needed feature I posted a while back about why Goodnotes was starting to “slip”. Noteshelf 2 has a feature I’m hoping Goodnotes copies very soon. And this is a guide line built into the zoom box allowing you to write in a straight line on blank paper templates. Because currently when you write on blank paper with no lines it’s difficult to judge if the line you make is straight or not. And when you finish writing it usually ends up looking crooked. This feature improvement would help. And this doesn’t need a major feature update to hold off til a version 6 is released but could be released now.,1586515514,Nothing specific.

Published: Jun 04, 2021

SACRAMENTO – California Governor Gavin Newsom released the following statement on today’s court decision regarding assault weapons:

“Today’s decision is a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent Californians, period. As the son of a judge, I grew up with deep respect for the judicial process and the importance of a judge’s ability to make impartial fact-based rulings, but the fact that this judge compared the AR-15 – a weapon of war that’s used on the battlefield – to a Swiss Army Knife completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this weapon. We’re not backing down from this fight, and we’ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives.”

California has led the nation in passing gun safety laws, having pioneered statewide protections approved by voters in Proposition 63 to ban possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring background checks to keep ammunition out of the hands of dangerous people. Since assuming office, Governor Newsom has signed multiple bills aimed at reducing gun violence, including strengthening gun violence restraining orders and regulating the sale of firearms and ammunition. Governor Newsom also worked with the Legislature to accelerate the regulation of ‘ghost guns’ to crack down on the use of untraceable firearms by criminals. Because of California’s commitment to meaningful gun safety laws, the state has one of the lowest firearm injury death rates in the country.",1622869165,"Governor Newsom Statement on Assault Weapons Court Decision

g1u13y,6,GoodNotes Writing &amp; Erasing Buggy,Question - iPad,"I've been using GoodNotes 5 for a couple of months now and have been noticing some strange artifacts when writing and erasing.

Whenever I'm zoomed in and writing small letters or mathematical symbols, it looks like GoodNotes sometimes attempts to ""smooth out"" my writing causing half of the mark I just made to curl up or disappear.

Example:  [https://i.imgur.com/boG2Biq.gif](https://i.imgur.com/boG2Biq.gif)  (notice how the bottom of the + sign gets abruptly cut off after writing it)

Then, recently I noticed that occasionally when I attempt to erase something, the text shifts or ""ghosts"" while the eraser tool is down on the page. ie. random marks appear on the screen that can't be erased, or weird effects happen with erasing.

Has anyone else experienced these issues and can suggest fixes?

I'm having problems with Goodnotes 5 on my iPad. For information: I work on the 11"" iPad Pro 2019 with 64 GB.

When I bought the iPad last year I thought that the storage should definitely be enough, since I'm saving my stuff mostly in clouds.

But I'm currently experiencing issues with the storage and I feel like they are caused by Goodnotes.

Today, while I was working on my notes, I had notifications that the storage is full and I should empty my trashcan (I honestly dont know if this is the correct word for it, but I use the german version and its basically trashcan in it). I did so and the took a look into my system settings and it said that Goodnotes is taking up 23GB of storage! I then checked my goodnotes backup, which I keep in my onedrive and all the files are only 1.7GB big.

I restarted my iPad and in the system settings it said that Goodnotes is now only taking up 1.7GB of space.

I wrote an Email to the goodnotes support but didnt get an answer yet. So I'll wait and hope for a solution.

gh9m46,2,Goodnotes takes up a lot of storage,,"Hello everyone,

I'm having problems with Goodnotes 5 on my iPad. For information: I work on the 11"" iPad Pro 2019 with 64 GB.

When I bought the iPad last year I thought that the storage should definitely be enough, since I'm saving my stuff mostly in clouds.

But I'm currently experiencing issues with the storage and I feel like they are caused by Goodnotes.

Today, while I was working on my notes, I had notifications that the storage is full and I should empty my trashcan (I honestly dont know if this is the correct word for it, but I use the german version and its basically trashcan in it). I did so and the took a look into my system settings and it said that Goodnotes is taking up 23GB of storage! I then checked my goodnotes backup, which I keep in my onedrive and all the files are only 1.7GB big.

I restarted my iPad and in the system settings it said that Goodnotes is now only taking up 1.7GB of space. 

I was happy and thought that the problem is solved.

But now I worked on my notes again for maybe 90 minutes and now Goodnotes takes up 10GB again.

I dont know what to do to solve this problem, so I hope maybe one of you can help me.

another little Update:

I got a response from the Goodnotes support team, but sadly it wasn't helpful at all. It just said, that the Backup Size doesn't reflect the actual size of Goodnotes and that the actual size also includes ""other stuffs like caches, app sources, indexing data, trashed items and also exported library/PDF files"" - well, I feel like that doesn't really explain a difference of more than 20GB.

They also adviced me to clean up my storage in general, delete/offload unused apps. I already had this option activated and - apart from that - goodnotes still takes up &gt;20GB.

&amp;#x200B;

But some of you mentioned that it might be a problem with the backup. So yesterday evening I disabled the autobackup to Onedrive. I hope that this doesn't cause me problems one day, but since my notes also sync via iCloud on all my devices I think that I will survive without Auto-Backup. 

Immediately after I disabled the autobackup the Appsize was down to 1GB and didn't increase so far.

So maybe this is the solution and Goodnotes should definitely fix their Autobackup.

I'll keep you updated :)

Have a nice day!",1589284382,"Hello :)

I’m most likely going to be buying an iPad for university (going into second year), and would use goodnotes. I’m just trying to figure out if 32 gb is enough, or if I’d need the 128. 

How much storage do your notes take up? I’d be sending pdfs regularly to my laptop bc I don’t want to risk losing them, so I’d be able to delete the notes from the iPad after finishing the course, section, or printing them out; I’d also only really be using it for notes, probably not even textbooks.

When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion &amp; Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/history) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1622869377,"Your submission has been automatically removed because it only has a title and little to none self text.   
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion &amp; Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

**Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/history&amp;subject=I%20expanded%20my%20post&amp;message=I%20expanded%20my%20submission%20for%20your%20review%3A%20https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/nso5cn/10_most_unknown_facts_about_india_that_will/) once you have expanded your post so we can approve it for you.**

I'm currently using GoodNotes 5 (version 5.4.26, most recently) on my iPad Air 1, and I've noticed that visualizing GoodNotes PDF's in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge always ignores small dots (e.g. the dots in i's and j's, periods, colons). This occurs regardless of whether I visualize the PDF's in the browser directly or via a file sharing service like DropBox, and I've noticed this rendering issue on both my and my friend's Windows 10 laptops.

However, I do notice that the dots are properly included when I visualize the PDF's in Internet Explorer, Adobe Reader, or just directly on my iPad Air 1 (which are either more intensive PDF applications/which use Apple's PDF renderer). That means that the dots are there, just not visualized in Chrome/Edge. I know Google Chrome/Chromium's PDF engine doesn't implement the entire Adobe PDF specification, but has anyone else ran into this issue?

As an example, I've included a link to one of my homework snapshots, which shows side-by-side comparisons of what I'm seeing on my iPad Air 1 and my Windows 10 laptop: [https://imgur.com/a/UggMdKt](https://imgur.com/a/UggMdKt).",Impressive-Ad-5713,Will you upload it?!

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM:WIRING:FRONT UNDERHOOD
**Summary**
VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: SEDAN, COUPE AND WAGON PASSENGER VEHICLES EXCEPT THE DX MODEL AND MODELS WITH V6 ENGINES. THE FACTORY INSTALLED AIR CONDITIONER WIRE HARNESS WAS IMPROPERLY ROUTED ALLOWING SOME WIRES TO RUB AGAINST EACH OTHER, EVENTUALLY CAUSING A SHORT CIRCUIT.


&gt; **Consequence**

&gt; THE SHORT CIRCUIT CANPOSSIBLY CAUSE THE UNDERHOOD WIREING TO OVERHEAT AND SMOKE, CAUSING A FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. A SHORT CIRCUIT CAN ALSO RESULT IN A BLOWN FUSE OR DEAD BATTERY.

The conspirator in me wants to say it was covered up after they learnt of the cause, but more likely is the case of a shoddy police investigation - car fire lines up with the injuries - teeth exposed to high temperatures (~4-700 degrees) will crack/fragment, cars reach up to 900 in a fire. I'd say that if there was a car fire (likely), the burns reported seem to underplay the severity a person would expect from a car fire (probably also just poor police work).

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",ynaffithall,Thank you!,1593053203,Thank you!,10,2

h8pxv5,1,App laggy due to photos,Question - iPad,"   Recently I’ve began to explore using goodnotes to journal. However, one thing I noticed is that adding photos to a page makes it insanely laggy—it’ll take up to 2 minutes to load that one page, and even after it’s loaded I can’t move stuff around too much or the page will go blank again. 

   Had anyone else faced this problem, and how did you get around it?",dorothyfan1,What specs is your iPad? I'm curious about this because I'm beginning to suspect the lagging issues may be due to the fact that the iPad models currently out there don't have enough internal memory to handle heavy loads. If that same document you have could be put on a theoretical Windows machine with plenty of memory this lagging issue would disappear. Or even an iMac Pro. If the iMac Pro ever goes touch enabled like the iPad...you could say goodbye to the iPad. So I double Apple will do this as it appears they're trying to replace the iMac Pro with the iPad Pro with the introduction of the new keypad.,1592149393,What specs is your iPad?

Using your own words: "" we don't have to know what they do in their bed, okay ?""

Why grant an Arab man with a childbride  who had no choice in the matter a shred of privacy out of 'decency' but protest  against what consenting adults do behind closed doors? Hypocrisy much? 

If you don't like Muhammad being reduced to his sex life because it's disrespectful, but LGBTs are reduced to their sex lives  and not whole human beings?

Why the fuck do Malaysians in South East Asia have to love a Middle Eastern figure except that their nenek moyang decided at some point to change their beliefs , and you , their descendant (probably), were raised in that imported Middle Eastern belief?

 IRONICALLY , you have even less rights to religious freedom than your ancestors because now our fucked up constitution made up a silly story about how you have to be Muslim to be Malay ( Le bullshit) that a lot of folks think of as a 'fact' carved in stone.

I don't think Aisha as a historical figure, was any saint or possessed any particular intelligence. She instigated civil war after the death of her husband, participated in tribal politics and caused the death of many people .

 She was also accused of adultery with a younger man , and honestly, being married off to an old man with a swarm of other women , it's no surprise that so many took it to be a fact. Her only cop out was Muhammad himself plucking a verse to save her reputation and ass ( since the penalty for Zina is death).

But I am totally aware of how for most Malaysian Muslims it's a sin to even THINK badly of her , so meh , RIP critical thinking.",1622869455,"Lol , so why are homophobes so obsessed with the consummation of LGBT relationships ?

hhuy5l,1,Goodnotes vs Notability vs Noteshelf,Question - Other,"I’m a first year pre nursing student and decided I wanted to go paperless to see how I liked it. I recently bought a MacBook and iPad Pro to help with my studies. Because of COVID my classes are online however, once it’s over I’ll return to in person. I’ve been watching a lot of reviews on YouTube but still can’t decide between these apps. I really don’t want to have to use 2 apps because I’d feel less organize. Some of the features I want are:

• the ability to import slides and annotate them ( preferably with the three lines at the side) 
• the majority of my books are ebooks so I’d like to be able to annotate those as well
• I’m taking a lot of science classes so I’d want to draw diagrams and trace pictures 
• user friendly",adlibquorum,"I both have Notability and Goodnotes, so I can answer for them.

Notability: NTs ink flow and shape tools superior to GNs. I find NTs filing system much more useful than GNs (especially better if you take a lot of notes).

Goodnotes: You have to take your time to make your handwriting pretty. However, your end product looks really good. Highlighting tool is still superior. Shortcuts like different pen colors, auto-deselect eraser and quick access to photos makes whole writing experience much more fluid. 

Overall, I think both apps works great if it is suited to your study and note taking aims. None of the apps currently has hyperlinking option. You can check out other typed note apps like r/RoamResearch for that.

hnyyki,1,Goodnotes update 5.4.32,,Yet another interesting update fix. Apparently this one deals with the autobackup feature sometimes requiring more disk space than necessary. I've been hearing about this problem for a while now when Goodnotes would cause disk space to suddenly fill up and people wondering about the autobackup feature. It's going to be interesting to see if this fix addresses the problem. The other fix has to do with the alignment of the paper templates in the vertical scrolling position. I'm wondering if this is related to an old problem I noted a long time ago about dark paper showing a thin white line on the right side.

Goodnotes had iCloud sync problem saying ""App version out of date. Please upgrade to the latest version"" even though in the app store it is updated to the latest version. By this time, there was still the blue dot for resizing textbox when it is selected. 

I decided that it's some kind of glitch and reinstall the app. The iCloud error message was gone, and the blue dot was also gone.

**What the issue is exactly:**

The blue dot does not appear when the textbox is created and when the existing textbox is selected.

When I copy and paste the text and make a duplicated text box, it gives two blue dots on the left and right sides. But when deselect the duplicated textbox and select it again, the dots are gone again.",1594725435,"**What happened before the issue:**

# Guy's I've found the solution as Goodnotes emailed me back:

Update Goodnotes to the version 5.4.35.

The bug, at least for me, appeared when it was on Goodnotes 5.4.34.

For some reason, I can't find the 5.4.35 update in the update section in the app store where all the other app updates are managed. [You have to go to the very specific Goodnotes app page of the app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602). (It won't say ""update"" even on the search page.)

hr07ip,11,Goodnotes 5.4.34 released,,Another interesting update. This one fixes the cache not getting deleted for some reason. And it supposedly also fixes a issue when you open a lot of documents causing slowdowns and possible crashes? I don't know because the description of this update is frustratingly sparse in detail. But given the description of the fixes suggests this is probably what I think these improvements are meant to address.,clarshmy8,"Despite the update I still get crashes from opening up my document :( ( it isnt a big one neither a dense one ) and I hope they fix their shape tool, cant seem to draw anything that well with it :(",1594794421,"Despite the update I still get crashes from opening up my document :( ( it isnt a big one neither a dense one ) and I hope they fix their shape tool, cant seem to draw anything that well with it :(",197,42

When inserting images if you long press on them and move them it duplicates it. Ideally I would like the same feature for text. 

If I try to do it now, it moves but then snaps back into place, which seems like a lost opportunity.

hu249c,8,Copy-Pasting faster shortcut,,"Hey! So whenever I want to copy paste some text I've written (like that perfect bracket } I just did) I do the usual of selecting, pressing, copying, long pressing, pasting. Which is a 5 steps procedure and seems excessive to me. 

When inserting images if you long press on them and move them it duplicates it. Ideally I would like the same feature for text. 

If I try to do it now, it moves but then snaps back into place, which seems like a lost opportunity.

So I am left Handed and have constant wrist pain, so I am always looking for something that will make me to things faster. I saw and old post here where someone built a custom Bluetooth Keyboard but me not being super useful with my hands I decided to look in the internet and see if I could find something that I liked and was functional.

Found those tiny Macropads where you can easily modify the keys with key combinations and that looked great. while navigating google images to see different models I found one with a Knob! a KNOB!! that is genius, sadly it seemed like it was a version that was out of stock navigated reddit to see if someone had a used one. Finally found a guy that made them, I asked him tons of questions such as if it would work with an ipad and was it hard to program etc.

He sent me videos and tutorials I said yeah why not. let's do it, I am not a techie person so setting up the whole thing so I could program the keyboard took me 2 hours, got the keypad today, flashed the file I did, it works like a charm. it is not fancy like the bluetooth one, but it uses USB C, and I just used a short one I had laying there (USB c to USB C)

anyways you can see it here

So I am left Handed and have constant wrist pain, so I am always looking for something that will make me to things faster. I saw and old post here where someone built a custom Bluetooth Keyboard but me not being super useful with my hands I decided to look in the internet and see if I could find something that I liked and was functional.

Found those tiny Macropads where you can easily modify the keys with key combinations and that looked great. while navigating google images to see different models I found one with a Knob! a KNOB!! that is genius, sadly it seemed like it was a version that was out of stock navigated reddit to see if someone had a used one. Finally found a guy that made them, I asked him tons of questions such as if it would work with an ipad and was it hard to program etc.

He sent me videos and tutorials I said yeah why not. let's do it, I am not a techie person so setting up the whole thing so I could program the keyboard took me 2 hours, got the keypad today, flashed the file I did, it works like a charm. it is not fancy like the bluetooth one, but it uses USB C, and I just used a short one I had laying there (USB c to USB C)

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/R4Rstralia, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/R4Rstralia/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

First I look through Pinterest for cool pictures (preferably pics for phone wallpapers). Then I open a new canvas on Procreate and I change the canvas size to the size of the cover (A4, A3, GoodNotes standard, etc.) and I draw a black line on the left side roughly 1 inch thick. 

And then add a new layer underneath and import a photo. Move the photo until you like the way it covers the rest of the canvas. 

After that, I exported the canvas as a jpeg into keynote on my laptop. That way when I’m making multiple, I can ensure the text box and the size of the cover stays the same. 

I change the size of the keynote to the same size as on procreate and I drag the new picture, with the black strip, to the middle where the guides help pop the picture to the middle. I add the rounded rectangle and eyeball it until I’m satisfied with where it is. 

And than I go to the top and hit file, then export to images and than you’re done! It should appear in a “documents” folder in your iCloud Drive.

3. those who follow the stickied posts for Ultimate Battery Life, which also entails using latest non-ASUS-approved drivers direct from Nvidia, AMD, Dolby, etc. after a totally fresh install of Windows, etc.

fwiw, i'm #2 and have ZERO issues with stability, performance, etc. since i got the G14. stuff you might have read about colour tones switching, or freezes, or black screens, or loss of Dolby, or out of control temps -- i have experienced none of that.

i'm plugged into the wall 98% of the time and use the G14 for work primarily. i game a bit, but am still working on titles that are 5 years old. so extended battery life and increased performance is not a concern for me.

iifupe,1,Highlighter behavior prior to v.5.40.30,,"Is there a way to user deselect the changes that have been made to the highlighter in version 5.40.30? 

The appearance of the highlighter and dark pages has become awful. The version release notes said changes were made to make the highlight or more visible.

The before version colored only the strokes

The after version (most recent update) puts the highlight over the text and also colors the area surrounding the text.

I did not get into trouble. Mostly because I agreed that whenever a situation justified me pointing out my stupidity, I would do so.

iueigw,1,How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5?,Question - iPad,"**TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen?",Eating_Well73,"I'm a PhD student and have imported 10-15 books, 70 (so far) articles and book chapters, several notebooks for notetaking (about 100 pages each), probably 30 annotated PDF lectures on my iPad. Once I import any PDF into Goodnotes, the app saves it in the .goodnotes format. And I save and backup all files in the Goodnotes format.

However, if Goodnotes adds audio recordings (I can only dream), then I can imagine my library size swelling.

I was kidding myself when I said I would use only Goodnotes on the Ipad.  It turns out Dropbox (for backing up), Procreate (to aid with diagrams) and the Iphoto library (where my screenshots from lecture material or internet go), Notability, and Anki take up another 30 gigs easily.

iueigw,1,How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5?,Question - iPad,"**TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen?",allevana,"So helpful, thanks so much! Some of the textbooks are really long (1k pages) but those ones aren't graphics heavy, just fat slabs of text, and then all my anatomy textbooks are full of pictures and diagrams but I only use one per semester so I'll be able to move the ones I don't need off the device if need be. I think it'll end up being okay. And my slide decks are provided by the University in .pdf format so that's really good! I'm glad the iPad doesn't lag too much once it's full",1600392923,"So helpful, thanks so much!

iumslp,1,A measuring tool in Goodnotes?,,Noteshelf 2 came up with a cool add on yesterday - a measuring tool built into the lasso tool. So when you rotate text in Noteshelf there is this measuring tool that precisely tells you what angle the handwritten text is in. Goodnotes simply lets you rotate the text but doesn’t tell you how precisely the angle your handwritten notes is. I hope Goodnotes is watching this and learning from the competition. I think this measuring tool idea is brilliant and kudos to Noteshelf 2 for introducing this in yesterday’s release.,jofkoch,You can post your suggestions [here](https://feedback.goodnotes.com/forums/191274-customer-suggestions-for-goodnotes),1600378989,You can post your suggestions [here](https://feedback.goodnotes.com/forums/191274-customer-suggestions-for-goodnotes),117,6

Thank you for your time!",randomaussie9730,"I used both, right now mostly good notes. Here’s what I like about GN5 compared to notability: 
- Better folder system 
- better pen personalization (can finely adjust thickness) 
- better zoom auto advance 
- my handwriting looks better 
- better paper templates and sizes 
- outline of imported PDFs 

And here’s what I wished they copied from notability: 
- voice recording (very hardly used but still nice to have) 
- import scanned document as image not as pdf
- change paper template for all pages in a document 
- change/edit pen thickness of selected text 

I used notability primarily for the past 2 years but recently got really annoyed with the paper template; the line spacing is either too narrow or too big, there’s no in between.

We have one stadium with capacity of 60,000 that needs massive renovations to be ""WC ready"", but it'll do. Another one has a capacity of 40,000, but is new so I suppose no renovations needed. Another one has a stadium with 34,000 and seems like it'll be renovated soon and will hold 40,000 so that'll be good. And that's it. We have 3 other ""larger stadiums"" with capacity at around 25,000, so ""renovations"" wouldn't cut it. ""Okay"", you say, ""we have three stadiums though"", except they're all in the same city, which under FIFA rules can't host more than a certain number of games. So, we have 1 stadium that's usable.

We also don't have great bus system, we'll need maybe 100-200 new buses to support the influx of people. There's no metro, so everyone will move around by bus. 

Also, there'd be a shortage of hotels I think since we don't get nearly the amount of tourists we'd get with a World Cup, so maybe we build a few hotels.

Our airport also only has 8 gates, so it may need some rebuilding too.

Oh, and we definitely don't have enough money for security or emergency services.

It's not that hosting it in Uruguay goes against this idea of not having diversity, it's just impossible. We could *maybe* participate if it's primarily hosted in Argentina/Paraguay/Brazil, but we can't really do much more than contribute with a singular atadium (that isn't even technically allowed to host anything more than the QF since it's so small). 

It doesn't have to be only Europe or the US, but Uruguay is possibly one of the least prepared places to host it in all of South America (I'd say Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela are all much more prepared - maybe Bolivia and Paraguay are right there with us). We are a tiny country with one large city (1.5 million) and less than 10 small ones (50,000-100,000).",1622869961,"Okay fine, Uruguay hosts it if the rest of the countries agree to pay to fix what needs to be done.

We have 3 other ""larger stadiums"" with capacity at around 25,000, so ""renovations"" wouldn't cut it. ""Okay"", you say, ""we have three stadiums though"", except they're all in the same city, which under FIFA rules can't host more than a certain number of games. So, we have 1 stadium that's usable.

We also don't have great bus system, we'll need maybe 100-200 new buses to support the influx of people. There's no metro, so everyone will move around by bus. 

Also, there'd be a shortage of hotels I think since we don't get nearly the amount of tourists we'd get with a World Cup, so maybe we build a few hotels.

Our airport also only has 8 gates, so it may need some rebuilding too.

Oh, and we definitely don't have enough money for security or emergency services.

It's not that hosting it in Uruguay goes against this idea of not having diversity, it's just impossible. We could *maybe* participate if it's primarily hosted in Argentina/Paraguay/Brazil, but we can't really do much more than contribute with a singular atadium (that isn't even technically allowed to host anything more than the QF since it's so small). 

It doesn't have to be only Europe or the US, but Uruguay is possibly one of the least prepared places to host it in all of South America (I'd say Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela are all much more prepared - maybe Bolivia and Paraguay are right there with us). We are a tiny country with one large city (1.5 million) and less than 10 small ones (50,000-100,000).",1945,347

1 love - search for 1 doesn't find it.  Search for love and the 1 shows up converted in the search.  So it definitely finds and transcribes numbers.

So then I tried writing a 12 as neatly as possible - boom it shows up - so somehow a single number or letter search doesn't work.  I also tried searching for the letter ""a"" - and that turned up nothing but ""an"" showed a bunch.

So maybe try writing 01 02 and 03 - I did that and the search found those.

j6uyxm,1,"""Your disk is almost full""",,"This year, I got an iPad air with 64 GB for the sole purpose of using it only for school. I take all my notes on goodnotes and have imported very large documents onto it, but it only takes up 4.84 of the 21.5GB used storage on my iPad. I backup my notes to my school OneDrive account because I like to view my annotated notes on my laptop while rewriting the notes on my Ipad. However, recently Goodnotes keeps saying my disk if full and recommends that I delete all the documents in my trash (which I've already done) several times in a minute. This happened about a week ago. At that time, the app also crashed and wouldn't let me go into it for a few hours, before I was able to go in and delete a huge folder and the pop-up disappeared for a few days, but now it's reappeared. Is there any way to fix it? I'm just scared because there are some notebooks that aren't backing up onto OneDrive and I am also very dependant on the app for school. Also, could anyone please tell my why I get the ""your disk is almost full"" notification when I still have over 40GB of free storage on my iPad. Thanks",ItsLisax,"One Idea you can backup your data, deleted and reinstalled the app

j9hwji,1,Alignment and sizing help please,,"Hello Darlings!

I am wondering if someone can help me.

I am making a sticker book in GoodNotes but i am having issues with making the stickers the same size and keeping them lined up properly.

Each sticker is an individual png and is pre cropped so that people can move them freely. 

So im not able to align them somewhere else and save a whole page of stickers because they need to remain independent.

So when i drag a png and drop them in  GoodNotes they end up different sizes. 
( Even though they were created the same size. )

This makes them all look disheveled no matter how i try to make it look nice.

Is there a way to make the stickers the same size in Goodnotes?

Is there an alignment tool so i know everything is straight?

I hope this makes sense. 
Please let me know if you can think of anything that will help.

jfsq7e,1,Notebook Covers,Templates,,SirBertLeaman,"I don't disagree with the majority of what you said, however, I do have a couple points I'd like to bring up. While I enjoy the Drive forms, I also still enjoy the gameplay when I'm not using them. Basic combat feels responsive and the player still has other options. I don't think the gameplay feels restrictive for them to be locked off here and there, especially if that's part of the challenge of the segment. ...And when it comes to the Pride Lands, you have to adopt entirely different gameplay mechanics anyway and that's always going to be up to the individual's tastes. KHIII has segments where the gameplay is entirely different for a time but it's woven into the gameplay pretty evenly to where it never becomes too noticeable; the pirate ship in the Caribbean, every world has some kind of minigame.

Another thing, KHIII absolutely gives you a ton of tools to use in battle but unfortunately their usefulness tends to vary. Apart from Critical difficulty, magic is pretty overpowered and gives the player little reason to use other tools unless you just want to for variety or to style on the enemies. The summons are pretty effective regardless. I feel like KHII encouraged you to use different abilities because different things were effective in different situations while KHIII has certain tools that are super effective throughout leaving the rest to languish. 

Similarly, arguably the most useful tools are locked into a system that as far as I know is still considered largely random. The meter you have to build with combos and magic to use the keyblade transformations and grand magic doesn't seem to fill uniformly and doesn't always give you what you're hoping for. On top of that, the attractions are an almost entirely random occurrence tied to attacking certain enemies. This is what's particularly frustrating for me. Like, these are tools I'd like more direct control over when I get to use them. Storing and swapping the keyblade transformations is super neat, even though I don't really care for the idea of the keyblade transforming in the first place.

Alot of it is going to come down to personal tastes, I think. KH games all have different play styles and gimmicks and it's kind of a toss-up if it's going to be what you're looking for. In my case though, I liked how KH2 built upon the original KH and expected the growth into KH3 to be along the same lines. I wasn't especially fond of the mechanics that the spin-off's introduced. I didn't hold it against those games because they were on systems that necessitated a more limited control scheme but I also wasn't expecting flowmotion and shotlocks to return in KH3.  


TL;DR It might just be a matter of taste and KH is all over the map with this stuff.",1622870113,"I don't disagree with the majority of what you said, however, I do have a couple points I'd like to bring up.

Brand new head coach and a Memphis team that has been gutted by players out on international duty WC qualifying and a red card suspension. Expect 17 year old academy players to be starting for Memphis tomorrow. While Indy has lost a player to international duty as well, they are in top form, sporting a great offense and a top 5 defense in the entire league. Indy should easily be the favorite in the matchup - i expect this line to drop significantly once oddsmakers readjust.

This is one of the best plays i've found in a while.

🐅🐅🐅

Edit: we broke the book again, boys. Line is down to 1.98 on my book. If you want to get in on this action late, I still like the bet all the way down to about 2.0. If it drops any further, I can no longer recommend this line. Good luck, guys!",1622870131,"🐅🐅🐅

The history of prejudice towards them is long and ugly, and it’s ignorant and hateful of you to perpetuate that bigotry, even in a seemingly “harmless” way of using your freedom of speech and then angrily doubling down on it.  Just because I (and many others) point out the inherent prejudice in your speech, doesn’t mean we are trying to be a victim for other people.

So, my question is this: how do you feel about Jewish people? If you don’t hate them, maybe consider that by equating being ripped off with Jewish people, you are perpetuating ignorant and harmful stereotypes. And instead of getting angry that people are trying to “regulate” your freedom of speech or way of thinking, maybe consider that there might be other forms of speech that function on a higher level, that can communicate what you are trying to say without being harmful, and will illicit better interactions with others.  You seem to think everyone here who is pointing out the ideological flaw in your choice of words is on some high horse, but maybe you fail to see your own high horse.

I'm looking for constructive things that actually benefit my time.  Time is scarce and life is short.

Not looking for emotional fights.  To even read them.  Fanboyism is barely on my radar, even though I acknowledge that it exists here and other places.  Occasionally it pops up and it's annoying.  I do check this place every day (usually) but maybe I'm instinctively not clicking on the dodgy ones?

My use case here is to keep up to date with AMD related news because I switched 2 years ago after 10 years with Intel.  No hate, I literally just care about multi core performance and better power consumption for long 100% usage workloads.  My last Intel CPU has been great and still works well to this day.  I now have 2 AMD systems and love that it's so easy to switch parts between the two for troubleshooting or upgrades, even if the parts are from different generations.

And also check to see what settings people are using, in terms of voltages, manual vs stock vs PBO.  Manual RAM timings, silicon lottery numbers (when people share their personal results after building the system).  I save a lot of these resources to my HDD for future reference.  And also.. when other people ask for help, if I know something, sharing that info and returning the favor.  Because when I first joined here, I knew pretty much nothing about the AMD way of optimizing the system.  With Intel I always used XMP, but with Ryzen you get better results by manually optimizing it yourself.  And people helped a lot in terms of sharing what they know.

I do agree with you.. that AMD users.. a large group of them do have a chip on their shoulder.  For many years their products were rubbish, and it's only been in the last few years that they've really transitioned into a competitive and now premium brand.  It used to be a value based budget option only.  Also.. in 20 years, the only CPUs I've ever had fail have been AMD.  But yeah, lately they have become really popular and more mainstream, and I have noticed a change here in the last 12 months.  But I rarely think of this place as toxic though, otherwise I would avoid it and find the resources elsewhere.

I don't understand the whole emotional side of the tech world.  Tech things are based on specs.  It's very robotic and mathematical.  I do care about anti competitive or anti consumer practices, but I've never understood the whole tribal thing in terms of Team Red vs Team Blue.  I use Samsung SSD's because I love their cloning software, the reliability and the speeds (not so much the prices, but if you buy during cashback periods it makes it easier).  It has nothing to do with being Team Black.

TLDR version.. I think what you might be talking about is a lot of AMD users have inferiority complex.

jm8vz8,1,“Highlighter on top of text” issue respond from GoodNotes!,,"A few days ago I wrote an email to GoodNotes about highlighter being on top of my texts and especially making the text underneath look dull. 
If you searched for an answer and couldn’t find one, here’s their respond: 

“I'm afraid the highlighting stroke has always been on top. If you use a highlighter color that's transparent, then it will take a huge number of strokes to eventually block the text it highlights, thus giving the appearance that the highlighting is behind the text. But if you try using a highlighter color that's more opaque, it will take just a few strokes to eventually cover the text. That means highlighting strokes are always on the top layer.

On dark paper, the general brightness of the paper is now detected and the strokes are adjusted accordingly to increase their visibility. Previously, if you drew or highlighted a white stroke on dark paper, the stroke would be almost invisible until you erased it and we got a large number of complaints about it. I realize this change isn't ideal, especially to users like you, and we'll think about introducing a ""behind-text"" highlighting mode so that more users can benefit.

Technically speaking for light papers, it blends with the text rather than behind the text. It just looks like ""behind the text"" for the blended effect. For dark papers, due to the limitations of Apple blend mode, the behaviour on the dark paper is currently the best we have come up so far.”",dokina,"I do really like that the highlighters show up more on dark paper but this is still annoying because if I use dark paper with white pen, the highlight changes the color of the white writing to a light blue or whatever lol I really hope they can implement this 🤞",1604284972,"I do really like that the highlighters show up more on dark paper but this is still annoying because if I use dark paper with white pen, the highlight changes the color of the white writing to a light blue or whatever lol I really hope they can implement this 🤞",261,51

New update allows undoing to remove the shape line instead of the highlight!,,,devil-wears-converse,"I wanted to share the contents of this update because I know a lot of people (including me) where a little muffed that a few updates ago removed a feature where we could could click undo to erase shape lines but keep the filled in highlight.

This is going to make my life a hell of a lot easier. 


Full updates:

""This update adds some more improvements to the shape recognition as well as other bug fixes:

- added “require hold to snap” option to the shapes tool. Disable the option to let lines snap to other lines again automatically without having to hold down

- tapping undo after drawing a filled shape will remove the line first instead of the filling

- added support for resizing circles in a fixed ratio

- fixed glitches when erasing small ellipses

- fixed recurring sync error alerts

- fixed an issue that caused text boxes to be duplicated after modifying it with dismissed keyboard

Seriously seriously painful experience. The worst part is the fact that the future went from being bright and sunny to being extremely blurry.

You know when stuff is shitty but you remember you have your significant other and even if everything else is shitty at least you've got your best friend? Its like that but not having the best friend anymore. It sucks. Shit happens and there is nothing you can do about it. Try to eventually take that lesson from it and realize that all kinds of tragedy are always a possibility. Try to build yourself up enough to realize that whatever happens it may suck but you will make it through it no matter what.

So I’ve been using Good Notes since April now and I never had problems with it. But since a few months I have this problem that handwriting is super laggy on my 2018 iPad.

It is so bad that if I draw a line from one end to another in a quick motion and if I already have been drawing without taking the pen off the screen, it could take up to 20 seconds until the actual line arrives.

jycxnn,1,Super laggy handwriting,,"Hey there

So I’ve been using Good Notes since April now and I never had problems with it. But since a few months I have this problem that handwriting is super laggy on my 2018 iPad. It’s not in any other writing app and my iPad in general is not slow. It is so bad that if I draw a line from one end to another in a quick motion and if I already have been drawing without taking the pen off the screen, it could take up to 20 seconds until the actual line arrives. It’s very annoying and really prevents me from using the app nicely. Also the laser pointer is like watching a Power Point with one slide each 6 seconds.",Panduin,"I have a lot of files in goodnotes. All my semester scripts.
I am often starting new notebooks, it’s always the same problem. No matter if on a blank page or a 200 page script.",1606011222,"I have a lot of files in goodnotes. All my semester scripts.

jyison,1,Presentation mode: Project whole page while using zoom mode to write,,"Title basically says it all: in classroom, when I project a panel and add student ideas, I'd like to use zoom mode to handwrite as legible as possible. Unfortunately the zoom gets presentated as well - is there any way to use zoom mode in presentation mode while locking the whole panel for presentation?

I know I just could use split screen for that. Often I need the second half of the display for my own references though, so that space is already taken up.

Thanks in advance for some hints or workarounds.",Denis_red,"If you use the third options from presentation modes (mirror full page), students will see the whole page and they will not see that you are in zoom mode.

I had surgery in the more pemissive period. Percocets made me psycho because they gave me insomnia and confused me so badly I didn't sleep for a week (and I can go with a lot of sleep)...I see pictures and my face was nearly grey.

So next surgery basically gave me something else that was morphine and I assume it is very addicting...

because I normally have insomnia I used it to sleep...scared of going crazy again.

It was a MOUNTAIN of pills. I did not feel anything when I stopped taking it....Once the pain was over--then I did not want it.

I mean--it constipates you! I'm surprised it causes so many people addiction....but pain is terrible.

I wonder about the psychological effects on people with chronic pain conditions.

Dependence on opiates is sort of a toss up for being worse than mind-numbing pain?

I don't get how people think about this when you're talking about people in hopeless crushing pain. Like...OK so you are 'hooked' but...is that worse?

I took a LOT for a long while...and was super happy at the sleeps it gave me which were he best sleeps....but I guess it doesn't suit me.

I think I have an addictive personality?

Anyway...the way the issue is approached is puzzling. Now people are resented for pain but pain is bad, right? So is it anyone's fault for wanting to avoid it? Is there anything  besides death that humans want to avoid more than physical pain?

Perhaps it is possible to become addicted from one generous prescription of opiates but pain seems bad also...

I'm very disturbed by the horrible stories I read about opiate addiction so I recognize how sad and terrible it is. But is there no way to medically manage the pain in some way that protects people? Why is this such a huge problem all of the sudden when there were decades where prescription opiates were not a huge problem?

Maybe the specific ones they have now?

And how depressing to ban kratom when this is a thing people take to get off opiate addiction.

It appears a matter of social control more than anything else. There are so many tragedies and yet you wonder if these could have been avoided with sympathetic medical care--but instead we brought the punishment hammer down.",1622870392,"That surprises me.

To solve, you need to ensure the image is literally the number of pixels tall and wide as the template sheet of paper you are using. That will cause it to display properly. So, get an image editor that will resize images by dimensions instead of apple’s built in photos app which resizes to preserve image quality shrinking it as you crop it down.

Basically I should have save them as a PDF instead of a jpeg as I guess jpeg does save the size properly

What appears to work is turn the saved jpeg file into a PDF. I did this two different ways

1. I pressed and held on the image of notebook in my file folder leading to an array of options popping up. The last option being create PDF.

Then I uploaded pdf copy to good notes, 

While this worked I did find I had white lines on the side of the notebook but the notebook was the same size as paper

Option 2 I did was I imported the jpeg image into procreate then re-saved as a PDF, this way I did not get the white lines when importing to goodnotes

I saw some people also recommended using pages to convert to PDF.

So the MCU is a combination of 616, 1610, and its own continuity. 

Obviously Normans power should come the Oz serum but instead of just giving him strength we should adapt the 1610 version and its should give him the ability to transform into the greengoblin. Now, he shouldn't turn into a big a monster like 1610 becasue we want 616 so this Oz formula should have some sort of basis on Skrull dna. Since the formula is still a very experimental drug something goes wrong and it only gives him the ability to turn from human to skrull. 

All this ^^^ is just to justify his green goblin face because having a slicone mask is just flat out stupid. The skrull basically look like green goblin and they look great in the MCU.

l132c1,1,New thoughts on pen thickness settings.,,I'm now of the opinion the size of the paper dictates the sizes of the pen thickness. Since most pdf journals being sold on Etsy use A4 templates writing with thick pen sizes will cause you to waste too much space to write simple sentences. I discovered the right size to use when using the zoom box is 0.45mm. However at regular style writing without the zoom box the right size to use from my point of view is still 1.2mm. The in between level is still 0.7mm. The only problem is when using the 0.45mm size is this causes writing to become too small to be legible. The only workaround is to either zoom onto the small text area or enlarge the text manually.,taipeifoodygirl,I personally always use 3 mm. Mainly because I don’t mind zooming in .,1611137578,I personally always use 3 mm. Mainly because I don’t mind zooming in .,70,14

You basically are losing alarms, reminders, easy reprioritization, connection to contacts, and a lot of other advantages you get just using your calendar, phone, and task apps on your phone that come with it. 

Handwriting a journal makes good sense, because writing by hand helps with catharsis and memory. Handwriting notes makes good sense, because again memory is aided by handwriting. Also, using a pencil to take notes in a meeting doesn’t seem like you are mentally checked out to the other person the way that typing does.

Öldürülmelerinin sebebi yetiştikleri kültüre veya partnerlerinin veya ailelerinin kültürüne göre onları rezil ediceklerini düşündükleri şeyler yapmaları ya da kız arkadaşlarının/eşlerinin  ayrılmasını kendine yediremeyecek kadar şerefsiz olması. Hedefi doğru belirlemiyorsunuz feministler olarak ben feminizm hakkında bir sürü insanın görüşüne danıştım ve bir sürü kaynağa da baktım. Yani yazacak çok şeyim var. Hedefi doğru belirlememe konusuna geliyorum, şimdi 10 çocuk düşün hepsi şişman ve hepsinde zeka geriliği var. Bu çocukları bir teste soktuk ve hepsi başarısız oldu. Başarısızlıklarının sebebi olarak şişman olmalarını gösterirsem tam da senin yaptığın şey olur. Oysaki başarısızlıklarının sebebi zeka geriliği olması. Şimdi konumuza dönelim 10 erkek düşün, bunların hepsi eşlerini veya bir aile üyesini kültürüne uymadığı için öldürmüş kişiler olsun.

I recently got an iPhone and wanted to use the app on my phone but I realize I'm not seeing it in my app list and when I search the app on app store it asks me to purchase it again. After some googling I saw a comment where it might ask you to purchase but you won't actually be charged -- so I went ahead and purchased it again, but I think I was actually charged for the app. After further googling, I see that GoodNotes 5 for Mac and iPhone/iPad need to be purchased separately but I do not own a MacOS device, I only bought iPad version which is supposed to be the same as iPhone version. What should I do in this case, has this happened to anybody else?",SheitelMacher,SHOTS FIRED!,1622870705,SHOTS FIRED!,12,2

Complaining about corporations covering themselves in rainbow has got to be the most privileged first world whining the face of this planet.",1204,197

I am in the camp of not all exotics need catalysts. Catalysts were a way to make Exotic weapons feel more like something that grows with you, they were introduced the same time as masterworking... or atleast very close together, it's hard to remember exactly, however, some exotics are just great, face value. it's why some catalysts so powerful, and others just add some throwaway stats.  


In the case of La Monarque and Wish-ender, I'd honestly want to see them buffed in some fashion first, and then have catalysts made after the buffs were analyzed. La Monarque could maybe get away with just having a catalyst that expands on it's effect, but Wish-ender has always needed some buff or rework to let it be more useful at a base level.  giving it a catalyst would be putting the cart before the horse.",1622870729,"Maybe?

I dont understand how this super common knowledge that can learned with a quick search isn't known to most cardiologists. I've been learning slowly that cardiologists are either absolutely awful and think they know everything or they are really good. Trust your gut and if it says you don't trust him tell him you want a second opinion. It is your right to get one. Off topic but the first time I had to get a second opinion is when a obgyn told me she was giving me a hysterectomy at 22 for heavy bleeding. I knew then and there i had to start advocating for myself big time. Since then I have been diagnosed with over 7 chronic illnesses and more testing still happening. My point being dont give up and make sure to advocate for yourself. Or if you are unable get a patient advocate. I'm actually getting one myself because I'm just tired of fighting so hard. I know we don't know each other but by your name and comment I just want to say you seem cool af!,1622870790,Hey its the wife here. I'm so sorry you've gone through this same bs. I wanted to get off the table so badly but im so fkn stubborn lol. Taurus here! I can't believe they said negative when it was 196!!! I dont understand how this super common knowledge that can learned with a quick search isn't known to most cardiologists. I've been learning slowly that cardiologists are either absolutely awful and think they know everything or they are really good. Trust your gut and if it says you don't trust him tell him you want a second opinion. It is your right to get one.

Bingo this is where you hit the problem perfectly. In places like Edmonton of you have a 50 ft lot they automatically let you split the lot in half to build two homes and they allow garden suites in many neighbourhoods, they also got rid of all parking requirements.

However, reality caught up with them and their demons, pasts, problems exploded in their faces. They are two imperfect people, damaged by life and haunted by demons. They hung on to each other because they desperately needed connection, were similar and needed to hold on to the peaceful feeling they had when they met. But the truth was that until they had learned to know themselves, to accept themselves, to work out their demons, and to make their own decisions about what they wanted, their relationship was doomed to fail. This is what makes it so tragic. If they had met at the right time, they might have worked out. Each knew it and that's what made their moment even more heartbreaking. They knew they were damaged and used the other to fill a void. But the strength and depth of their love caught them off guard and shook them even more.

However, reality caught up with them and their demons, pasts, problems exploded in their faces. They are two imperfect people, damaged by life and haunted by demons. They hung on to each other because they desperately needed connection, were similar and needed to hold on to the peaceful feeling they had when they met.

Yes, I agree.

&gt;Also, she never raised problems with his love of alcohol/blood (or never raised these points at all -- these are an assumption by you). Her only contention with Robert we know of was that he wouldn't keep to one bed. Which she seemingly (if you believe R+L=J) forgot about that contention with Rhaeger.

We don't know enough about lyanna or her story with rhaegar to say things for sure. I extended her displeasure to the other two things bc they might come up later on. One could also say that she was simply making up excuses bc she just didn't like him and/or didn't want to get married at all. We can only especulate for now.

&gt;And certainly Lyanna might change or grow up or out of her contention or learn to live with it 

Yes, but would she learn to love him? There could be a chance, but we can't know for sure. With Robert, her being only conformed with their marriage could be enough to break his heart. He loved her, wanted to have an ideal life with her and he always wants to have what he whises for.

They regularly respond with “We will add it to the list!” Explanation: software development usually involves working in teams from a backlog, and in order to control the flow of work, the teams will put things on the backlog, prioritize those requests, and then only work on the most valuable things at the top of the list. They do this regularly every week, couple of weeks, or month. 

That’s how they handle their internal business requests for features. They say “added to the list”, do some math, and then prioritize it. Usually that means it is put nowhere in range of any near-term work, and you are blown off.

This is a terrible way to interact with a customer because it is non-transparent, which violates the values of most software development, and it is misleading and deceitful. 

Instead, they should publish their plans for all new features for the coming year, let you know what those priorities are, who they are for, and why they are working on them. If you make a request, they should honestly answer “We have that on our list, but not this year and maybe not next” so you can grieve and go away.

People will be refreshing the App Store every day wondering if their latest reddit post or tweet has their favorite feature in it. 

But don’t feel too bad. I have been bitching about the highlighter and eraser in GoodNotes for a LONG time, and I have never even gotten a reply.

ljoxwb,1,Please help me understand the backup system.,Question - iPad,"I don't have iCloud on my device (Long story)  


So, I am relying on Google Drive for backup purposes. Now My notebooks are being backed up as individual PDFs, and another Auto Backup is being saved as a ZIP file in google drive when I choose to back up. Now from goodnotes's forum, I found out that the ZIP file is for one-tap restoring, if I change the device or uninstall the app I can just IMPORT that ZIP file, and everything will be downloaded and sorted as before. My question is then why are the individual PDFs? it's just taking double space in my Google Drive by saving the same file twice.",shinrak2507,"that is something that was on my mind as well.

it is super weird tbh.

especially, you can just open the zip file and import the PDFs separately.

50% correct, the civil rights act no longer protects political affiliation for employment however most states do, California being the biggest among them.

However no, if people genuinely wanted to start discriminating in that way you would very quickly see all states pass similar measures because business owners are more often conservative.

More than that, but they certainly realize what you fail to. If you want to force the issue of only hiring people you agree with politically, the left will lose overwhelmingly.

lnm2w6,1,question about documents with links in Goodnotes 5,,"Hello, I have partially migrated from Notability to Goodnotes 5.  I use both on my iPad Pro 12.9 2020.  My friend got me to buy Goodnotes 5 because of it's collaborative tools.  

One thing that I like about Notability is that if I import a PDF file that contains clickable hyperlinks in it from GoogleDrive on iPad or from the files app on iPad is that the clickable hyperlinks remain clickable inside Notability.  So for example if the PDF allows you to click on a reference in the bibliography and jump to that point in the bibliography then you can still do that in Notability following the import procedure that I mentioned above.  Similarly if the PDF contains a clickable link to a web page.

When I try to import a PDF document starting in the files app on my iPad and send it to Goodnotes 5, then when I open the document inside Goodnotes  5 it always ""flattens the links"" so I can't click on them anymore...  is there any setting in Goodnotes 5 that enables me to save the clickable links inside the PDF file while I am reading the document from within Goodnotes 5?

Self care is setting boundaries, eating well, going to the gym, addressing stressful situations, having hard conversations, paying my bills on time, getting enough sleep, learning positive coping mechanisms, making my health a priority, and doing all the hard things I don't want to but will make me feel better in the future. These things can not be a reward, they are necessary for creating a healthy life.

Self soothing is the binging tv, eating favourite snacks, having a nap, luxuriating in the shower, going for a nice meal, feeling better in the short term things, making myself my favourite cookies, reading in bed all cozied up. They have their place, they make us feel better in the moment (which can be important) but do little to address long term issues in our lives. Self-soothing activities can be rewards! I use massages as a reward for hitting goals in the gym.

I am all for treating myself and taking time to enjoy things. I make a point of doing things I enjoy every day, of finding pleasure in small things. I also set rewards for when I reach goals. I think we should all take time to enjoy the little things in our lives be it a hot shower, a walk in a pretty park, our favourite tv show, or a good snack. But we should also be doing the hard things to make our lives healthier so we can be more resilient and able to take charge of our lives.",1622871028,"For me self-care and self-soothing are different things.

Bitmap means a bunch of discrete pixels, like a photograph. That's what you have here, and you can tell because when you zoom in it looks blocky and pixelated.

Vector means that information about curves and shapes is stored (rather than pixels) so that you can zoom in as far as you like and it will still be crisp. One way to get vector-based graphics in a PDF is by exporting from an app like GoodNotes or Notability. 

For example, I have imported into GoodNotes a PDF generated by someone else using Notability, and GoodNotes is able to recognize the handwriting and let me search it.

m6cp5r,1,Create Paper Templates for GoodNotes in ZoomNotes,,"Hi, everyone!

As many of you probably also do, I tend to experiment with a ton of different apps and templates. I always feel like things could be a bit better. 

One of the apps I’ve experimented with a great deal is ZoomNotes. While I love all that it has to offer, it always feels a bit too junky for me. 

One feature I *love* is it’s ability to generate template based on very specific parameters. You can adjust size, color, grid type and size, add columns, and a ton of other things. Just tap the + symbol, create a new document, and tap “Custom.”

It’s super useful! I feel like I haven’t really heard people talk about it, so I thought I would bring it up. If you are always wanted to fiddle around with your templates, it’s a really great tool.",BookWormAttorney,Thanks for Sharing.,1615923725,Thanks for Sharing.,19,3

I was just wondering, if i am alone with this wish.

I used to be a onenote user and really appreciated the amount of settings i can tweak to make the program look/work/feel exactly like i want it to. I got myself an 12.9 inch ipad pro and i am kinda disappointed by the lack of features of goodnotes.
Don't get me wrong, goodnotes works great and the feeling of writing with it is great imo, but still. I would like to have more colors via quick access, not just three, maybe some sort of better zoom feature, so i can set some presets for zooming in/out. Also the way the zoom-box works kinda disappointed me. I can't move it wherever i want, if i want it to be on the top of the page, i have to put the menu on the bottom? Why isn't the zoombox like ""a normal window"" which i can place wherever i want it to be? Or have it like splitscreen, when the ipad is horizontally on my desk?

mhd00x,1,viewing only the pages with notes on them?,,"Hi all!

I made the switch from Notability to GoodNotes about 6 months ago, and for the most part vastly prefer how it organizes notebooks. But a lot of my work involves importing and then marking up long PDFs, and Notability has a feature where you can view thumbnails of only the PDF pages that you've written notes on.  Super handy if you've got to type up your notes and there are only, say, 10 pages out of 100 you have thoughts on. Is there any way to accomplish a similar feat with GoodNotes? To see what pages of a PDF you've written on?

mkh1qd,1,Easy way to include outline actually ON for example second page of a document?,Question - iPad,"So outline works. That’s great as long as you stay on your iPad. Opening your outlined pdf (editable) export gives a neat overview of the chapters you’ve set, also when reading in Apple Books. 
BUT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT ADDING YOUR OUTLINE EFFECTIVELY ON A PAGE. Did none of the devs really think of that or am I just missing something? 
Right now, I have to take a screenshot of the index in iBooks, return to my Goodnotes document, add the screenshot to page 2 or 3 to create an in-document table of contents... 

Seems crazy; is this the only way to do this?",JB_horn_ME,"Yeah, that's pretty rough. Also, if trying to open the editable PDF on a Windows laptop, the pages tend to take a while to load due to being editable and (in Chrome PDF viewer) the bookmarks tend to be off by a page.

I've resorted to outlining my document as I write it out and then making a table of contents manually on the first page based on the outline. This allows me to export flattened but still know which page covers which concepts, etc.

Definitely takes a good three or four minutes for longer lecture notes (which can add up over time), but it's what works best with my academic workflow.",1617647089,"Yeah, that's pretty rough.

Thank you!",eulersheep,"The thing with quantum is we don't even have a proper theoretical framework in place for writing quantum algorithms, like what von Neumann gave us for classical computation. We know a few algorithms, like Shor's, but they've essentially all been guessed. People like the analogy that quantum computation is in a similar state now as classical computation was in the early to mid 20th century, but it's not even that far advanced yet.... a more appropriate analogy would be an abacus...

The hope is that by at least building the hardware, we will get more insight which should also help the theory to progress. But it is a monumentally difficult task. There may also be some physical limitations that ultimately prevent us from building quantum computers with thousands of qubits in coherence (required for quantum error correction to execute Shor's), i.e. a real quantum computer might need to be planet sized (or something like that).

That's not to say we won't overcome these problems in the future, but I'm just trying to emphasize how much work there is still to do in this field and how difficult the problems are...",1622871333,"The thing with quantum is we don't even have a proper theoretical framework in place for writing quantum algorithms, like what von Neumann gave us for classical computation.

Been using GoodNotes for the last couple of months to take my office notes digital so I can scribble things quickly and then rewrite more neatly later on.

Also started using GoodNotes for personal journals etc and think it would be great to have different profiles set up so you can choose your Pen Thickness and colour options via Profiles.

n5f1o6,1,Glitches in the writing....,,"From the video, I am having 2 issues with goodnotes right now. 

I am using an iPad Pro 11"", Apple Pencil 2. Changed to a fresh tip just to confirm it's not the pencil, tried notability and notes just to confirm its not the screen protector/ipad screen itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 1: if I write something or highlight something, and immediately switch to the eraser, it will not be able to detect the last thing I wrote. like how I could not delete the highlight until I tapped on the screen (you see me tapping the screen and the eraser turns up on screen at 0:13) then it would ""recognise"" the highlight

Issue 2: the glitching!! gets on my nerves and honestly was the reason why I (had to) switch to notability. i use goodnotes to project my notes in my classroom and it was causing glitches every few lines I wrote. I have been using goodnotes for over a year and this has only started happening this year. Happens everytime I scroll after writing something, the last character I wrote will always glitch.

I have never been in a healthy relationship. Not a single one was just loving and supportive. There was either a major psychological issues I was being used as a crutch, deeply chaotic emotional patterns, or outright physically abusive behavior. How could a person look forward to another round of this. My sense of inner peace is very important to me, I would dare say it is the most important thing to me. It is not worth the potential risk to my peace of mind and overall sense of calm to be involved with someone. I can be self-aware enough to realize that unhealthy people are drawn to unhealthy people, and you'll only ever end up with someone who is as healthy as you are. So it's not the other people, it's me. I have to be as healthy as possible to connect with the right people.

Not a single one was just loving and supportive. There was either a major psychological issues I was being used as a crutch, deeply chaotic emotional patterns, or outright physically abusive behavior. How could a person look forward to another round of this. My sense of inner peace is very important to me, I would dare say it is the most important thing to me. It is not worth the potential risk to my peace of mind and overall sense of calm to be involved with someone. I can be self-aware enough to realize that unhealthy people are drawn to unhealthy people, and you'll only ever end up with someone who is as healthy as you are. So it's not the other people, it's me. I have to be as healthy as possible to connect with the right people.

As a perfectionist but also someone who loves writing in pen, I would constantly be stressed out in fear of messing up my notes and having to scratch out work on paper. On the iPad, you can just undo it and forget it ever happened!

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",kaesekarl,"I started digital note-taking in my last year of school. I used a Lenovo Yoga with onenote to write stuff down. I mostly write mathematical stuff so having a pen for these is a no-brainer for me. I gave many people advice on digital note-taking, which device is the best one for them etc, and i boiled it down to a few questions you should ask yourself :

1. Do you ACTUALLY need digital notes? What is the real benefit of making them because it's kind of hyped now and many people just ""do some scetches"" or just ""write that one equation down"", for those it is probably not the best thing to do. Don't forget: Digital note-taking is expensive. Every device which is capable of taking digital notes with a pen is relatively expensive, ipads (especially the pro-line), laptops which can be flipped(like the one i used) or laptop/tablet hybrids (like the surface pro).

2. If you decide it's worth your money, pick a device that fits your needs. If you pretty much only use a pen (and have a ""real computer at hand) get an iPad, the pen is straight up the best in the game. If you also need some power on the go, get something like the yoga, it's a solid laptop with up to 8 cores, 32GB of ram, blablabla, depends on your needs and also if you use this as your only machine or as a secondary device.

3. Maybe a normal laptop is just right for you? If you study something like languages, economics or law, you will be mostly writing texts. So having a good keyboard is a necessity. In that case, a normal laptop would be pretty much all you need. Be honest with yourself and don't just buy something because ""well XY is using this for his studies so it must work for me"".

4. Do you have the skills to actually benefit from the digital world? I know, this sounds harsh because ""of course i have those, i mean this is the modern world and i live inside of it"". But believe it or not, many of my colleagues just don't have the skill set to efficiently take digital notes. Not just copy/paste, but you have to adjust your work flow, keep your data in a useful structure, make backups (seriously, if anyone reads this and doesn't have a backup of his/her notes, make one right now) and many other things like ""how does my colleague get this thing"", what if i want to collab with people etc etc etc... 


Paper with a pen let's you do everything you can imagine, but every application, every device you use is designed by people who are thinking different than you. I got really frustrated while trying to find THE PERFECT App for taking notes until i figured out, not a single app can do everything i want it to.
I still use a good ol' paper-notebook for brainstorming, just because it gives me the opportunity to do exactly what i want, no ""super smooth curves"" or ""super clean images"". Some things are just messy in and of itself, and nothing is better at capturing your thoughts that a piece of paper and a pen.


Maybe this sounds like a rant, i am really not, but maybe this should be a step into seeing the downsides of digital note-taking and not just the beautiful future we want it to be...

If you want some further advice, just pm me, budget, usage are pretty important factors (as i already mentioned) so with more information about your future use case etc maybe i can be a little more helpful",1620671775,"I started digital note-taking in my last year of school.

At least during the lectures. I usually wrote a study guide on my laptop but it wasn't perfect. I always wished for a way to make it pretty and efficient by highlighting definitions in boxes or just highlight with a digital highlighter. To be honest I think I would have been happy with paper notes but I always wished for an iPad it was just too expensive I thought.
In my last year I used a surface thinking I would have a laptop that's easy to carry around for writing stuff with a keyboard but I also wanted to take digital handwritten notes. My biggest problem with taking digital hand written notes on the surface was that I was using one note and it just didn't work for me. I've searched ages for an app that would let you annotated PDFs and also let's you put pages ""in between"" because my studying often required answering questions in the scripts. All the apps I found were prescription based and thats's just unnecessary expensive imo. I just hated that I had three binders for math because I wanted to have the questions of the lecture of my homework and of studying separately. With goodnotes you can have these different binders all in one place.

I also want to highlight the functions of digital notes during covid-19. My university requires us to upload our homework or work in teams online. And it's just so much easier to share your screen or send an email with you homework without scanning it first.

I always swore that I would never make the switch. I lugged around my pens, mildliners, and Moleskines in college because I was determined not to go digital. Then I started thinking about grad school and realized that things like books and articles could be exported into Goodnotes and annotated, and I caved. I would never EVER switch back. I love digital notes SO much. 

edit: (I have the iPad Pro)

edit #2 lol I truly never read other poster’s comments before posting my own. I skim them. This is in response to mathematical Lenovo user. 

Firstly, I would be wary of any Microsoft user who is warning you off buying a Mac product. In my experience, it’s 80/20 that they have a strong anti-Mac bias. (I used exclusively Microsoft products pre-2016)

Secondly, I have a Macbook Pro 2016 and an iPad Pro May 2020 model. These are my two primary devices. My use for them will be different from our mathematical friend over at Lenovo. Still, I’ll say this from my own experience—I am shocked just often I reach for my iPad after years of using my Macbook for everything. Now, this will not be your case. The iPad Pro can replace some functions of the Macbook Pro, but even then, it can’t substitute itself for one. However, with a keyboard and a mouse, you’re a hell of a lot more equipped to run the iPad as a “Mobile Oval,” to lovingly quote from “Veep.” It’s your presidential replacement on the go, and from what I understand, even the iPad Air can handle that. (Isn’t the Gen 2 Apple Pencil now compatible with the Air?) 

Secondly.Two, if you’ll take a recommendation from me, ditch the stupid keyboard case and cut straight for the Logitech super slim keyboard. It’s waterproof and weighs very little. I love mine. Get a cheap case from Amazon or something. The keyboard cases are ridiculously overpriced. The Logitech keyboard is something like $70 and holds a charge forever. 

Thirdly, I don’t know what your learning style is, what your major might be, or what else you may want to consider, but digital note-taking is an excellent idea for people with significant reading loads. I was an English education major, and I’ll be attending a master’s program for journalism this fall. I foresaw a hefty reading load. That means I had to lug around several literary anthologies, print out hundreds of short stories etc., etc. It would’ve saved me money to buy the iPad in the first place. 

Fourthly, I do want to point out that you shouldn’t be buying the iPad because of what you see from this trend in digital note-taking. It’s very pretty, and that is definitely why I love it, but it is a considerable expense. I am impulsive by nature. If you are wise, you may want to have someone sit down with you and work out the figures. 

I would say I printed well over 8k pages while in undergrad. That’s for sure lowballing. I know for one class alone, I had to have printed at least a thousand. And that was one single semester. Weigh printer costs against what you would save. I don’t know. Maybe you will break even, and perhaps it’ll be significantly more expensive to buy the iPad. I’m not a math person. 

Fifth, and finally, I think it’s essential that you have something to look forward to going into college. I think it’s worth noting that I use my iPad every single day and have used it almost every day since I purchased it. Now, granted, I did buy it during quarantine, so that’s not a perfect example. However, I do use Goodnotes every day, and I am currently not working and am not attending school until the fall. 

Some highlights:

* I love digital planning now. I was never a consistent planner before, but now I try to plan out my week (or at least jot some things down). I bought my planner from Three65Planners on Etsy, and I highly recommend it. It’s loaded with hyperlinks and templates. 
* Organization. I have severe ADHD, and my organization has always been “throw things anywhere.” Goodnotes’ search feature is fantastic, and I have tons of folders. 
* Color options. I have 150 pen presets, and 48 highlighter presets on Goodnotes. Think about lugging around 150 pens and 48 highlighters, a huge planner, and 70 journals. That would suck. 
* Stickers. Digital stickers are super fun. I have over a thousand digital stickers saved! 


A downside:
* Learning to write on an iPad sucks. I highly recommend getting a palm rejection glove. My handwriting looked like a third-grader when I first got my iPad.",1620673832,"I agree with everyone who is saying that it takes time to get used to!

“I would highly recommend it. I got one my second year of college and haven’t looked back. I honestly forget what it’s like to take notes on physical paper.

From my experience, I’ve encountered a very small amount of things that made me say “ugh” since the switch.

I’ve motivated like 4-5 of my friends to switch to digital note taking and they’ve enjoyed the switch. One of my friends has atrocious handwriting and him switching helped him create more readable notes to reference later. Just remember it works for some people better than others. I know people who’d rather take paper notes because the feel and it helps them retain information better. If you have an Apple Store near you or a friend who has an iPad, give it a try.

I don't really get your first point... I know some of my windows/android using friends like really hate apple for... Well everything. I gotta admit, i was one of them a few years back but that has changed.

Today i am a mess when i comes to operating systems:

I use an android phone, the big IPadPro, a windows pc, a windows/linux laptop and a Linux server (like no graphical interface). I still didn't get to like macos very much but that's just because i love to tinker with stuff so having a mac kinda limits me in unnecessary ways (probably there are workarounds n stuff, but i like the way my machine works) plus i also game some time so gaming on a mac was never the best experience... I just use things the way i like to work with them,who knows, maybe soon i will have a macbook because of THE ONE THING, but maybe i won't :D

But i totally get why people use them, don't get me wrong. Especially the new imac models are just *pheew that's hot*... While talking about ""digital note-taking i mostly refer to writing with the apple pencil, after reading my comment again, i kinda mixed things around when talking about that.

I had an iPad since March 2020, I bought the pencil this January 2021 and I thought that “no I need to write on paper so that I don’t lose the habit of writing on paper” (because all my exams for the next four years are subjective three hour long papers where I have to write pages and pages of answers)

And then I got curious and I started using Apple Notes

I organised everything year wise and subject wise (I’m now in the second year)

And I really liked it

I only had to carry this one device to the lecture hall

And I could use split view to read textbook PDFs in iBooks

And then I discovered GoodNotes

Yeah Apple Notes is amazing

But goodnotes just simply blew my mind away

To be honest I don’t really spend on Apps because I think if I don’t use them then I’ll waste the money
(Except Apple Music and Netflix haha)

So then I watched [this](https://youtu.be/83RhJEyzCKc) video that compared Apple Notes to GoodNotes and then I thought why not give it a try

And then I bought it in March 2021

And when I started using it, I couldn’t even imagine all the things this app could do! It can do SO MUCH (some might think that it’s normal, but for me, a newbie, I was, and still am in awe of this app)

Plus my notes are much neater and more enhanced as I can add and delete stuff later on, and also I have endless colours and images and stickers to make them look appealing and functional at the same time

I cannot simply come to terms with the fact that all I have to study is in one device, that is with me wherever I am

And because of this pandemic and how it has affected my country (India), I had to constantly move from my hostel in my medical college to my home and back because of the varying restrictions

And I couldn’t be more than grateful

And of course there is iCloud, so everything is still safe even if something happens to my device (god forbid)

Also there are many video lectures that I watch, so I can just use split view and write away (again, just one device)

So now I have realised the importance of digital note taking

And I can only imagine the stacks of physical notebooks and tons of binders I would’ve collected over the years, trying to search for one small important lecture that a teacher had taken 4 years ago

Okay this is too long, but hey thanks for asking for personal experiences with digital note taking, because I’m honestly proud of myself for doing this🙈

I bought a used iPad Pro 11"" May 2020 because I was tired of printing 8-15 page assignments/tests to write in the answers, scan them back in, and email to the instructor. He HAD to have hand written answers, would not accept typed. I talked to a tech/nerd friend of mine for help and he suggested iPad Pro with 2nd Gen pen.

Planner/Calendar  
Notebooks for life stuff  
Business notes for the business I am starting

I download PDF books from z-lib and read them in GN - then I can highlight, write notes, etc.   
I download my college text books from z-lib (free BTW) and take notes, etc during class.   
PDF instructions for sewing patterns  
Sewing pattern file notes  
I had created a hyperlinked notebook for a surgery I had in 2020 that I was able to export as a PDF to my surgeon   
Scan word search pages into the app for something to do on the go that isn't social media linked LOL 

My daughter has an iPad Air and she was taking notes for a big test in her FFA class and worried she would not have enough information.

Even asked if he could have a copy to share with the others. 

The possibilities really are endless. I am currently setting up another iPad for a friend who is a contractor. He lives out of notebooks and sticky notes and it is a complete disaster. So I am setting him up to transition to the digital world to make his life more efficient and his business more professional/productive.

Loved it. For my purposes, I took a lot of engineering courses which are not worth trying to type notes for - plus there were a LOT of diagrams. 


I also have a back/shoulder injury, so I try my best to carry a light load. Currently I teach said engineering courses, so I have an iPad Pro for giving notes and marking up drawings. I can share my screen and it's much more comfortable for me than writing on a whiteboard for long periods of time. I also refuse to accept hard copy drawing submissions for my drafting courses. It's much easier to mark them up in a pdf and send them back to my students, and it prevents me from carrying 100 11x17 drawing packages (and saves my students $$$).


I like being able to move things around, and create space for additional ideas that fit in with something I've written previously. Goodnotes is great for all of the folder options, and I like the fading pointer feature when I'm going over a PowerPoint.

Basically I solved over 60 question papers. Many questions were easy. But some are either new conceots or too much to memorize. So I want to compile all those questions topic wise into flashcards on my iPad, so that I can do spaced repetition.

The thing is the question papers are hard copies and I used blue and red pens to scribble additional information near the questions. So while making flashcards, I don't want to rewrite using apple pen or type on a keyboard. It will be a waste of time.

Basically I solved over 60 question papers. Many questions were easy. But some are either new conceots or too much to memorize. So I want to compile all those questions topic wise into flashcards on my iPad, so that I can do spaced repetition.

The thing is the question papers are hard copies and I used blue and red pens to scribble additional information near the questions. So while making flashcards, I don't want to rewrite using apple pen or type on a keyboard. It will be a waste of time.

I want to click photos of the questions I find difficult, annotate them and then make a flashcard with a small heading/question. What app will be suitable for that purpose?

nkvhjz,1,Outline Shortcut?,,[deleted],Designer-Strength159,"Did AA at West Point 2 years ago. It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

nl1zq8,1,Outline Shortcut?,,[deleted],Designer-Strength159,"Did AA at West Point 2 years ago. It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

noi3jd,1,Custom Templates Not Syncing,,"Custom templates I create and import to GoodNotes on my iPad do not sync to my iPhone and iMac.

Have already tried all the common solutions, nothing fixes the issue. I submitted a very detailed support request to GoodNotes, but thought I would ask here if anyone else is experiencing this?

All documents and custom elements are in sync across all devices.

Any ideas?",roakmi,"Received a reply from GoodNotes earlier today. Seems it was my error, I did not select the correct paper size and color to match my templates, that's why they did not show up. A stupid mistake, but something to check if you can't find all your templates on other devices.",1622435860,"Received a reply from GoodNotes earlier today.
