agpzxb,1,What happened to the pen (Goodnotes 5)?,,"I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour.

I’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm).

I love being able to set exactly the thickness I want, whereas with Notability the smallest is too small for me, and the second smallest is too big, for both ball point and fountain. I have no idea why, but the writing in GN4 also just feels smoother and more responsive. Don't get me wrong, I love Notability, but GN4 is just that little bit better for me.

1.  Is there a way to auto-create extra pages (like in Notability) as opposed to having to pull each time you want to add a page?

Do I just have to start from scratch?",NumericalSystem,"These are my thoughts exactly. There's definitely some lag on the pens, and my handwriting is nowhere near as nice as it is on GN4. Also, GN5 seems to have the Notability problem of ""the smallest pen size is too small and the second smallest is too big"" (in my opinion, anyways). In addition to the lag, there seems to be some sort of ""bleeding"" with the pens, in that I stroke, the line appears, and then it kind of thickens/changes shape a bit. I'm using the ballpoint pen too, so it shouldn't be changing at all. I'm using the iPad Pro also, so I'd assume we should be having the least amount of lag problems. It's a shame, because the vertical scrolling was one of the two key things keeping me somewhat tied to Notability (the other being recording, which is invaluable for tutorials where there are no lecture recordings).",1548173606

There are some QOL features that i can’t understand why these apps don’t have them like having a preset quickbar so when you change tools you don’t always have to tap 3+ times. I just want to tap once. And the toolbars have tons of space. GN5 has space for 3 colours and 3 sizes but not tools and that’s just not enough. 6 “tools settings” would be far more useful but more is better too. ",1548973117

GN5 will be great if they fix their problems but they should have sorted this all out in beta during the past several years of development that they’ve had while ignoring the glaring QOL issues in GN4. I’m afraid by the time it’s usable again I’ll have switched back to notability because GN5 is just a different kind of pain in the ass. I’m only using it now because I started a notebook and I don’t want to recopy into notability or have weird change in paper halfway through by importing the PDF.

Thx",Revolutionary-Win-51,"Vaccines aren’t all the same and this is the first large scale rollout of vaccines using the ChAdOx1 platform and mRNA in humans. So comparing mixing COVID vaccines with say nonavalent and bivalent HPV vaccines isn’t really relevant given the novelty of the COVID vaccines.

And while other countries are mixing we should remember that some of the countries you mentioned also put a halt to the AZ vaccine because of concern for blood clot risk while we ignored their precautions. So it’s a bit disingenuous to point to them as examples of us being on the right track when months ago we were ignoring their concerns and being told there was no risk of blood clots.

I agree we should give people the choice but the government should also be upfront about the unknowns and not try to paint a picture of false confidence. I mean they are trying to use preliminary results from two unpublished studies as support for this approach, that is laughable. Giving people the choice without the information to assess risks isn’t really giving them the ability to make an informed choice. They’re posing it as a “do you want Coke and/or Pepsi, there really isn’t a difference and it’s just up to your personal tastes.”

It’s obvious from COVID that the general public lacks the understanding of fundamental concepts relevant to disease and disease control so they must also be given open and transparent information about the vaccines. Not just “don’t worry about it, it’s fine” like they did for every other aspect of COVID including it’s risk to Canadians back in February 2020.",1622867900

I get that in this situation a lot is going on. The cop is stressed and likely afraid for her own safety to some degree and her adrenaline is high. I can even see how, in the moment, she could mistake her shot for the suspect shooting. But once the scene is cleared, and things have calmed down and she can see things rationally, there's no way that she, or the other cops involved, could have simply ""not realized"" that she was the one that shot her partner. That means that she and the other cops involved all reported that the suspect initially shot. They all reported it in a way that made her fatal shooting justified, and to cast the suspect in a worse light. That is literally a cover up. 

Yes, she made a mistake, but she still tried to cover up that mistake. There can be an ongoing investigation and a cover up simultaneously.

You're absolutely right that resisting arrest is not the best thing to do. And that resisting arrest is much more likely to result in you getting injured or killed. But that doesn't make it okay for cops to kill people when they resist arrest. 


And, as far as ""POC crap"" there is statistical evidence to prove that people of color, particularly black people, are killed by police at a much higher rate. Here's a study by Harvard.

bn8vce,5,Thoughts so far about GoodNotes 5,,"Over the last few years I have jumped between GoodNotes, NoteShelf and real note books. Until now. I think this new version of GoodNotes, especially when the new version rolls out for the Mac, is just about spot on.

The writing isn’t quite as smooth as one or two other apps I have used on the iPad Pro but it’s acceptable. The feature set is getting better all the time and having the tabs at the top combined with a quick drop down list and a full document library view, it has so many excellent user friendly features.

So why not 5 stars in the Apple App Store?

It’s almost perfect but few things in life are truly perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Like wouldn’t it be great to be able to hide the tool bar while writing if we wanted to? I’d also like to have smoother writing (Noteshelf and even Microsoft’s OneDrive app write smoother). I’d also like to be able to customise the toolset to have what I regularly use in the order I want them (I never use shapes, photos or camera so I’d love to replace those icons with more quick access pen colours, for example).

Martin",spb478,"Just comparing GN4 with GN5, GN4 blows GN5 out of the water. I used GN4 for almost a year before GN5 was released and I NEVER had an issue with it. I'm so incredibly disappointed with the release of GN5. I downloaded GN5 the day it came out and was so stoked but I quickly realized that it had been released too early. Even the Goodnotes team admits that they didn't want to wait any longer to release it, which to me implies that they rushed at the end. From the majority of the people I have talked to the disappointment is stemming from the developers. I've reached out to them once and their response to me was basically 'be patient or switch to GN4' which is basically impossible after using GN5 for any period of time since you can't back import your notebooks to GN4 from GN5. On top of the fact that they removed basic functions from GN4 and have yet to bring them back. Their blog says that these features will be reimplemented ""soon"" which at this point I have no faith that it will happen. Simple features like the tool shortcuts in the zoom window or being able to set a right margin should never have been removed in the first place. Not to mention that every time an update is released, they're updating shit that doesn't matter or whatever bug they're claiming to fix doesn't actually get resolved. The developers have severely disappointed a large portion of their loyal followers and they aren't doing much to make us feel better. So that's probably why it doesn't have 5 stars in the Apple App Store.",1557560282

Martin",milkkyu,"Exactly, there’s only so many times you can hear ‘just wait, we’re working on it’ before you just get fed up. I’m still waiting for non-iCloud back-up and the zoom window shortcuts too. There probably are bugs that we don’t notice are getting fixed but it just feels like there hasn’t been progress for so long. The bug that I *really* need to get fixed is when I’m zooming in to a document sometimes it snaps back out and I have to zoom in again, and vice versa when I’m trying to zoom out. And there’s more that I can’t even think of right now. 

I do use GN5 and I like it, as broken as it, but it definitely doesn’t deserve 5 stars as it is. I think it will be a 5 star app when it’s finished, but who knows how long that would take. At the moment it kinda seems like we’re beta testing the app fpr them honestly.",1557578267

Martin",rlmasn,"Terrible performance/speed in GN5.  I think they switched to a monolithic sql database and it slows down dramatically as notebooks get larger.  With 50-100 pages of handwritten notes it becomes much slower.

GN5 doesn't cache page images, it re-renders a page even when nothing on the page has changed.   If I am writing on page 75, the first 74 are not likely to change, so they should have been cached as images rather than re-rendering all pen strokes each time I look at them.  Slow scrolling.

The Zoom window lacks tools to switch colors and they say they aren't going to bring them back.  It is so inefficient dragging your hand to the top toolbar to switch colors (and putting the toolbar at the bottom is a nuisance).  Cut and paste and many other things can't be performed within the zoom, it must be closed and re-opened to do simple things.

Repeatedly clicking things is inefficient.    Time wasted playing around with the software interface rather than getting things done!

Another example is converting handwriting to text. It is much easier in Noteshelf 2.   Unfortunately Noteshelf doesn't have vertical scrolling.

The developers just don't seem to ""get it"" anymore, and this is 5 or 6 months after GN5 release.   I wonder if they even use it to take real notes in the modern fast paced world, or test with large handwritten pdfs.",1557762185

It’s almost perfect but few things in life are truly perfect. There’s always room for improvement. Like wouldn’t it be great to be able to hide the tool bar while writing if we wanted to? I’d also like to have smoother writing (Noteshelf and even Microsoft’s OneDrive app write smoother). I’d also like to be able to customise the toolset to have what I regularly use in the order I want them (I never use shapes, photos or camera so I’d love to replace those icons with more quick access pen colours, for example).

Martin",davemacdo,"Same here! I'm sticking with GN4 for lots of reasons. There are some great features in GN5 that I'd love to use, but I really extensively on both PDF backups to Dropbox and presentation mode. The thing that bugs me is that I often find myself recommending GN4 to colleagues who are also iPad Pro users, and they're stuck without a sync'able Mac app, since the older one was removed from the App Store. I get that they don't want to confuse people who are just getting into GN5, but maybe they could make the _old_ GN for Mac available as a free download from their site or something in the meanwhile?

bt9pj9,7,Does anyone know how to fix it? when it does I can not write,,,faux_artisan,"Replying to self to acknowledge the downvote, and to add some more background.

I used Goodnotes 4 for a long time. I tried them all - GN4 was top of the pack. The best handwriting engine. The best PDF and template handling. The best bookmark handline. Switching context to read-only to use embedded links in a PDF was a bit of a pain, but worth dealing with as everything else was great.

I was excited for GN5. On launch day I ponied up the upgrade fee and downloaded it, eager to see the improvements.

And then I used it.

Bookmarks were non-existent at launch. And, when reimplemented, it was done so in a way that was a step back from what we had in GN4.

The ink engine was, and still is, a step back. At launch it was buggy and inconsistent. It's got better, but it's still a long way from where it was.

The bookmarks implementation added post-launch is awful compared to what we had before. I use this a lot so I have to keep coming back to it. Existing PDF bookmarks have been reinstated with inscrutable, uneditable, unchangeable names. The recommendation from GN Support was ""Speak to the orginal PDF author."" I am the original PDF author. The bookmarks look fine everywhere else.

So when I say ""fix it by moving to Noability"" it is not a flippant ""my thing is nicer than your thing"". GN5 is still a buggy mess. You only have to look at the posts in this sub to see that.

It wasn't ready to launch. It's still not ready now. Upgrades are supposed to be an improvement on what went before. GoodNotes 5 was not, and still is not.",1558935017

chgp51,1,bundle price questions and potential feature?,Question - iPad,"1. if both goodnotes cost 10.99 then i would be paying only 10.99 for the bundle? why is it rated so bad on the app store for the bundle? 
2. What is wrong with it? is it the bundle? of the apps themselves? are the apps different from buying it separately? 
3. Some people say goodnotes 5 was really a down grade compared to goodnotes 4, is it true?
4. I also noticed in some posts here that when buying the bundle it still shows that you have to buy both?
5. will goodnotes add an audio recording option? like record audio while writing?",scykei,"1. No idea why the bundle is rated badly, but the bundle was created so that users of GN4 can upgrade to GN5 for free. You should just get the bundle because it will give you both versions. 

2. I think point 1. answers this too.

3. To me, definitely. I like the new interface and infinite scrolling, but one thing that I can never get over with is that they changed the inking behaviour. I used to love GN4 for their pen alone, even though they were missing some features. They changed the only thing I cared about. GN5 is also a battery hog compared to GN4.

4. Don’t know how this could happen.

5. Don’t know, but I’m sure the devs are aware of the demand for it. I’d honestly just recommend that you go for Notability if you want this feature. Their implementation is flawless.",1564064203

If you wanted to go for realistic representation, obviously you could just make all the characters whatever you wanted 🤷

Note I did originally say that putting a lgbt hero in at the same time would have definitely been a better choice for representation, would be 2 characters instead of 1 and would show that they aren't picking an anti-lgbt stance",1622868582

Cheers!",SinaiOutlander,"Ok so the ""light moving faster than light"" analogy is not apt at all here. First of all, this illusion relies on the fact that each photon is separate. As you know, each photon cannot violate the speed limit. If I shoot two photons in opposite directions and they hit something at the same time, the photon did not just teleport.

None of this violates physics, requires extra dimensions, or is relevant to the behaviour of a large physical object moving in 3D space.

The original point of this thread was that if its a 4D object moving in 3D space it might explain the unusual behaviour like moving very fast or turning very fast. Just because we dont know how they generate that power doesnt mean it violates physics or requires 4D to make sense.",1622868582

**in my opinion -** the shapes feature in GN is terrible, and probably the only reason that made me take my math notes in Notability. Why? 

1. You cant reshape after forming a shape
2. if you want an *even* triangle and you're not precise - good luck with that.
3. that actually extra step to activate shapes mode rather than just holding the pencil and waiting for something to form is annoying.

Other than that and the auto backup feature which will be added soon, GN is great.

I have had GN5 installed on my iPad for a while now, and have come across some things that could be improved

1) The app seems kind of slow and laggy when scrolling through documents, especially if there is a fair bit written on a page

2) Writing occasionally disappears and then reappears

3) The colour code doesn't show the one of the colour currently selected. It always shows FFEEFF

4) Squared paper isn't sized how it should be compared to actual paper. On real paper you have squares that are 5mm wide and tall. The closest I have seen is the ""squared paper"" template, with 5,75mm intervals

5) Pen sizes in GN4 and GN5 use different systems. A ""1"" in GN4 is approximately a ""0,2mm"" in GN5, while a text marker ""10"" in GN4 is a ""2mm"" in GN5. Am i correct in assuming a 1=0.2 ratio?

Thank you.",lorlwrnc91,"One thing I can’t stand about Good Notes (and every other note taking app except for Apple Notes) is that there isn’t an option for a pencil that fully functions like an actual pencil. Good Notes doesn’t even have a pencil, and Notability has one but it doesn’t act much like a pencil but more like the ball point pen in Good Notes. I like the pencil to be pressure sensitive (I mean really really pressure sensitive), and I like it to look and shade like a real pencil. I don’t think that will EVER happen.

It annoys me, because I like certain things about each of the note taking apps, and I wish they’d make an app with all of it combined into one. I’ll start to think that I really really like a note taking app, and then one little thing will throw me so off that it disgusts me. Lol. I guess the cons outweigh the pros is what I’m trying to say, and it is very bothersome. I believe there are a lot of issues with copyright, and so that’s why they don’t all have the same features.

I really like Apple Notes, but when I go to put my palm on the screen it goes crazy, highlights everything I’ve written, and if I’m not careful I’ll accidentally hit delete. You can undo it now, but think about how horrific it was when you couldn’t retrieve all of the notes that just took you hours to write!!!!!

Good Notes feels very basic to me. I’m not sure why, but it’s just like their tools are very basic. There is pressure sensitivity on the pens, but its finicky. It only want’s to do a basic stroke instead of a real time pressure sensitive one (if you know what I mean). The shape section is so annoying to me too. I can’t actually insert a shape from a drop down menu (if I can I haven’t seen how to yet), and I think it’s kind of strange that you have to draw the shape. It takes a million tries to get it perfect and the way you want it to be. You can’t resize it after it’s done. Then stuff with files, drag and drop, etc.There are so many little things that nag at me, but that’s a few of them.

Eventually I get so mad I switch to another note taking app. I’ll use that one for a while, get mad at all of the issues with that one and switch to another one, and repeat. It’s an annoying dance I’ve been doing for a while.",1574923522

1. I've never seen this -- could be because of the iPad I'm using. I've noticed lag on my iPad mini 4 occasionally, but... I've not seen what you're talking about, more that sometimes the screen will be blank for a bit before rendering. But that is an older iPad.
2. I have never seen this. I've handwritten more than a thousand pages. What model iPad are you using? I think that might be the difference.
3. I've never seen this, Trying it now I can't get that to happen.
4. Goodnotes is a little frustrating in this way. It \*always\* scales the paper to fit in on the screen so you're basically never seeing the paper at 100% zoom. It is always larger or smaller than 100%. The only way around this is to make your own templates that are carefully measured to exactly match the editable screen size on your device. I've done this for the iPad 11 Pro with the Graphics app. It's not that hard to to do but it isn't easy. I agree that this is frustrating. At the very least they should put a 100% zoom control somewhere so that you can get things properly sized regardless of paper size.
5. I don't understand what you are saying, but I suspect that you're seeing something similar to #4 but regarding pen diameter. The pen diameter is dependent on how zoomed the current document is. A 2mm pen will only appear to be 2mm if the doc is at 100% zoom, which is problematic (see #4.) This too can be fixed by making your own templates and always using them: you will have consistent pen width. Otherwise as you switch between different page sizes the pen will seem thicker and finer, which is confusing.

In the future it would be very helpful for you to post you iPad model and what version of iOS you are running when asking this kind of thing. Cheers.",1575084380

The pressure sensitivity and line width are zoom-dependent, so the pen will have less sensitivity and a finer line on a page that is larger than your screen and is therefore zoomed down and will be fatter and much more pressure sensitive on a page size that is smaller than the screen and zoomed in. It is confusing and annoying.

But I do wish that GN had the Apple Notes pen/pencil tools and could make links to documents and pages that I could use in other apps to go right to a spot in a specific document.

About Apple Notes and PDF annotation, OMG! That’s one reason that I bought Good Notes. I can not stand that you have to “mark up” a PDF to write on it. I hate it, and it’s so hard to do in Apple Notes because you have to scroll with two fingers to scroll down the PDF. It goes all crazy and out of whack, and it makes pencil marks with my fingers and does all kinds of stuff that I don’t want it to do. There is a lag when I mark up a PDF, and I’ll draw (for example) a circle, and it lags horribly. It will put the circle in the wrong place, and once I lift my pen it will jump to where I was originally trying to draw it.

The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. 

2) I will try to recreate that. 

3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code 123456. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me #123456 but #FFEEFF

4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.

5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals. In GN5 you go from 0.1mm to 2mm in 0.05mm intervals.",1575125913

I would like to think that they are working on it but to be honest there’s *still* tons of features that need to be brought over from GN5 from GN4. 

I agree with you on presentation mode, I’m not against it per se but I have no idea why they decided to work on it when there’s some many other features that more people were asking for. 

Auto backup has been on the beta of GN5 for a while now. It’s working very well for me but it’s possible there’s some weird bugs they still need to fix, hopefully it gets pushed to the main release soon...",1576559332

I use Presentation mode and Auto-backup every day for work. I assure you that there were more people complaining about the lack of Presentation mode in GN5, perhaps just not in such public ways.

GN5 is a ground-up rewrite that was necessary to support new APIs in iOS, macOS, and web services. They needed to get it out so they could support those, and also to sell enough copies to support future development. Since then, they have prioritized feature parity with GN4 to support longtime GN users who use all of the features that had to be removed in the transition. For what it’s worth, Apple did the same thing several years ago with the iWork suite, and it took _years_ to get all the features back. And it’s only in the last couple major releases that they have added significant new features. Obviously, Apple has a lot more money and a lot bigger audience than GoodNotes. 

My point is: you can’t expect the team to drop all the plans to support current features to build a _huge_ new feature just because you personally would find it valuable.",1576632715

Is anyone has the same issue? How can we fix this?",Taafr3535,"Pardon the length, wanted to make sure my numbers were right. The reference to the $400k is a perfect example in that it is extreme, and it wasn't just top leadership. The highest paid officer WAS patrol and he made $414,543.06 (in 2019). It's not a dishonest argument and it is all publicly available data. The fact that this was even possible and that there isn't a system in place to prevent this is unacceptable. Do you honestly think otherwise? I hope you never complain about taxes ;)  The Seattle Times said ""For example, the median for officers who worked at least 1,000 hours was $167,000."" The avg working year is 2000 hours, so that means there are a lot of officers who make over $167k with full benefits and taxpayer backed pensions. A Forbes report from last year states that the avg US salary for a police officer is $67,600. So Seattle officers, on AVERAGE, are paid $100,000 dollars more per year. I openly acknowledge there are additional considerations such as cost of living but there is no angle in which someone can argue in good faith that these officers are not well compensated. They should be well compensated but within reason and competitively.

Now, my opinion is that the officers are leaving because they don't feel respected or appreciated. They are here to serve the community and right now that community is critical of them. Instead of taking stock of what truths may exist and how to bridge that gap, there has been some outright rejection of service to the community. It's basically a threat, accept us as we are no matter what we do or we may just stand by and let your community deteriorate. If a group has the power to legally take a life on behalf of the community, that community should absolutely hold that group to a very high standard. That is why they do deserve to be paid well. Same as why we hold medical professionals to a higher standard. When a job includes having people's lives in your hands it is very important that they get it right, every single time.

As for the de-fund police argument, it's a slogan, it's meant to be provocative. If calm normal community conversation provided the solutions people were seeking, that slogan may not have been so prevalent. My point stands that in the light of day, the average person wants more focus on mental health resources being the first responders (in applicable scenarios) to manage the response in a different way. If funding is the reason we can't have it, then a natural place to make adjustments is from what it would be replacing. That slogan was meant to force a conversation and it did. Sadly real change can't happen without some friction and forced uncomfortable conversations.

The same folks arguing all protesters are rioters are often the ones saying one bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch when it comes to police. I agree with that. But what we have seen again and again (nationally) is the blue wall and that police will back those bad apples to the bitter end. The bad apples aren't even fired in most cases, let alone held accountable to their community. That's a choice and if they choose to stand together then they should expect to fall together in the eyes of the community. The discomfort they feel is meant to inspire them to adjust that mentality, not abandon their responsibilities in retaliation. Neither plan has worked and no one is happy so maybe it makes sense to reset the table and people on both sides to start to show up with solutions instead of knee-jerk defensiveness and raw hostility. Or....we can stay entrenched in our corners and echo-chambers and at least we will all be ""right"" even if everything falls apart because of it.",1622868778

I solved all these issues by using Autodesk Graphic to make my own templates. I carefully sized them to fit the editable are on my iPad Pro 11's screen. I made a wider and a narrower lined paper, a graph paper and a blank sheet. I named them ""my wide lined,"" ""my narrow lined"" etc. Now I only use these templates and when I need to choose them I can pick them out because of the names.

I wish that Goodnotes was built to allow more consistency to prevent just the kind of issues you are having. Alternately I wish Notability's pen pressure sensitivity were more like Goodnotes. As it is Goodnotes and Apple Notes are the only apps  where my handwriting works properly.",1576728527
ee2bd6,1,Import PDF template with multiple pages,,"I have a PDF with 4 pages and I’d like to import all 4 pages to GN5 as template.

But i can only import the first page into template folders.

Anyone can give me some advices?",n9n9n9n9n,"templates are single pages -- the pages that autofill in a notebook as you add them.

for my forms that I fill out over and over I do one of two things. For an experiment template, say, I have an empty document that I duplicate in the file browser to a new document and then fill out.

if you have a notebook that you just want to have the same four pages in over and over you can set everything up, then go into the page viewer, then select, then select the four pages and copy them. then exit the ""select"" view by pressing done. Then at the end of the document you will see an empty page with a + sign in the middle. Press that and if you choose paste pages it will paste the pages you copied at the end of the document. You can do that a bunch of times.

Then it played breathless, confession, baby and then crazy sexy cool. I found out their name through csc but I didn't know all the mvs I had watched were from the same group. It continued and played always you afterwards. My parents were talking about how handsome they were lol.  I was planning on googling astro after I got home (I didn't have data at the time) but I went home really late that day and forgot the name.

 My mum was watching koms and it happened to be sanha's episode. Once again, my parents talked about how good his voice was. I thought it was nice and relaxing but I wasn't interested in kpop at the time so I wasn't paying much attention to the show. After sanha introduced himself as part of astro, I got hit with deja vu. I couldn't remember where I heard that name before so I dropped it. 

One day my mum was looking through dramas to watch but got distracted with something so she left the TV on the drama selecting screen. Idk how else to phrase that lol. I saw my id is gangnam beauty and saw eunwoo on the front. He looked so familiar to me but I still didn't remember where I saw him. Once again, I dropped it.

I was starting to get interested in kpop in 2019. Not enough to stan any groups. Just to listen to a couple title tracks and watch a couple kpop related videos. I watched a compilation of mvs. Still don't remember what the title was but I skipped through the video and ended up watching a part of all night. It was the choreography scene and I only watched a tiny bit of it. Saw the name astro, thought it looked familiar but once again, I didn't bother looking into it.

Saw Rocky's mask inspired dance in my recommended for days. Finally clicked on it and watched a bit of it. Wasn't into watching dancing at the time but he somehow managed to make me watch it. Afterwards, I slowly started watching dance videos. Rocky's magic honestly.

Was watching some kpop video. Honestly don't remember what I was about when I read a comment that said astro's eunwoo was friends with bts. Also read about that in some article.

Then I stumbled across the poster for true beauty's drama. I was a webtoon reader and my favourite character was suho. I saw the poster and immediately thought he looked familiar but I still didn't know where I had seen him. I wasn't into kdramas at the time so I didn't bother watching it. 

Then I found a true beauty interview in my recommended while I was using YouTube. I watched it because I was curious and they had a question on astro. Found it familiar again and this time, I finally gave in and looked them up. Watched the all night performance video thinking it was the mv. I'm stupid I know. Then I watched their reaction to it and absolutely fell for the chaos. Also realised I didn't watch the mv. So I watched the mv, loved the aesthetics. Watched their pool party video then found a link to the cicada video in the comment section. Subscribed to their YouTube channel immediately and watched the videos YouTube would recommend to me. 

I watched all their mvs and wondered why most of their songs/mvs were so familiar. Then I made the connection one day. Don't know why it took me so long honestly. The more I got into them, the more I realised I missed so many chances to become an aroha earlier. But I guess it's fate. I finally became one after the universe kept shoving them at me.",1622868826

I feel like I've been hearing about them in late 2017/early 2018.  
The game has extremely poor development pace in regards to core gameplay mechanics.   

I'm having an impression the only thing that truly evolved since then is the meta game. By meta i'm not meaning as in people min-maxing, but the non-raid gameplay - the menu part - flea market, hideout.



Now lets think how well BSG/Nikita were realizing his vision of realistic game so far:

- They listened to community and increased armor values of helmets to unrealistic values
- They listened to community and increased armor values of face shields to unrealistic values
- They listened to community and introduced new fake ammo types for each gun to counter the fake armor
- They listened to community and introduced a surgery kit - now you can fix all the mistakes you made during raid in 15s!
- They did nothing about mag-dump meta
- They did nothing about ADAD

These are the most glaring things, I don't want to even bother listing all the small stuff.

Not a single system was evolved since 2017.  
He must be truly having a ""vision"" for the game. On podcasts, because not in his actions.  
If only they did *something*, I would shut the fuck up and wait patiently. But I'm just getting nothing but negative signals and at this point I'm disgruntled customer who's feeling cheated.",1622868877

But is there a way to export an entire notebook at once into text using this app? The only options I see are as a PDF, GoodNotes, or an image. This may be really easy, but I’m kinda bad at learning how to use new apps when I get ahold of them.

You could spin that scheduled trips list like it was the big wheel on price is right... just countless trips.  Every single pickup was a scheduled trip. Best part was the dam entire city would be all covered with the demand and bonus areas graphics and not a single scheduled trip would net you a bonus or surge.  No clue why but its was lame lol.  Yes tons of rides and one after another but no bonus trips or anything.  Flip on uber and no requests ... hmm 🧐,1622868975

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

f96ddj,1,Apple pencil switching issues,,"My setup: iPad Pro 12.9” w/ Apple Pencil 2nd Generation

Does anyone have issues when they double tap their Apple Pencil to switch between the pen and the eraser in GN5 and it lags?

Example: You are writing something with the pen, you double tap the apple pencil to select the eraser. When you go to erase, the pen is still selected so you end up writing instead of erasing. When you lift the pencil, GN5 correctly selects the eraser and you can erase like normal. 

I don’t recall having this issue in Noteability, so I don’t believe it is a bug in iOS.

Along the same lines, is there any way to adjust the double tap speed so that GN5 doesn’t pick up false positives? Or in other words, is there a way to set the double tap speed really high so that it doesn’t switch on accident as often as it does?",duckslayr,Almost a daily occurrence for me,1582730905

It has just cropped the page. When I try to select it with the lasso tool, it only reaches about half of the missing part.

fsm63y,1,Goodnotes 5 is falling behind Noteshelf 2 on a crucial feature.,,"I love Goodnotes 5. I think it’s powerful and very good in giving people the ability to organize notes and offering the templates people can use in their everyday needs. But there is one small feature that a rival note taking app has that I hope the developer for Goodnotes looks at seriously for improvement. Noteshelf 2 is another handwriting app which in my opinion is quietly gaining on the big 2 - Goodnotes and Notability especially because it’s introduced a handy little feature people are ignoring  - giving people the ability to adjust the line spacing while writing handwritten notes.

You might smirk and sneer at this but if you are using blank paper templates with no lines when jotting down notes - you wouldn’t laugh when looking back on your own writing and seeing your handwritten notes veering off wildly downward or upwards slanted in such a way you might lose track of your own train of thought. Well, Noteshelf 2 has Goodnotes by the shorthairs on this one because the developer was clever enough to foresee this issue and introduced the line adjustment feature built into its zoom box writing utility. Noteshelf 2 lets you see the line you’re writing on in the zoom box so wherever you’re actually writing on the page you simply write your sentence on the given line in the zoom box. This allows you to always write your notes in a straight line even on blank paper with no lines. Not only that but Noteshelf 2 lets the user adjust the spacing of the line so this way you can squeeze the notes you write onto smaller surface areas when dropping down to the next line. 

Goodnotes only gives the user a simple zoom box magnification mode letting you write in the box. But this doesn’t prevent you from veering off course if you write on unlined paper. This is the one area I hope the developer of Goodnotes looks into and copies Noteshelf 2’s clever feature to make it possible for people to write sentences in straight lines on unlined blank paper. Just my two cents.",dijon360,"Agree.  You know, I've never understood why folks only ask about Goodnotes/Notability when Noteshelf 2 is on par and in some ways superior to both.  Perhaps it depends on workflow, but I get on so much better with Noteshelf than I did Goodnotes 5 or notability.",1586458438

Suggestions?",qcametti,"I tend to use screenshots and then croping the photos. I use Windows and screenshots are stored in a folder which I allow access to anyone on my network. This way I have the files app connected to my PC and I can access the photos without them really being in my iPad. Once in a while I delete the whole folder where these images or screenshots are located in my computer.

I use GoodNotes in full screen and the files app floating hidden on the right. When I have to paste an image from the PC I slide to the left from the right side of the screen to show the files app and then I drag n drop the image. The photo is in GoodNotes in less than three seconds.

I may seem a little bit tricky but once it's set up, it works perfectly and saves me a lot of time. Specially during virtual classes.

I don't know if Macs have the option to share like this by default. If it doesn't, then you can try setting up your computer as a samba server. I've done this in Linux and it works the same way. There are really good guides on how to set this up. If you want to try this and have some questions about it let me know, maybe I can answer them.",1586066262

fyd7sb,1,Yet ANOTHER bug fix released this morning! 5.14.17 update.,,Stabilization fix. This MIGHT be related to the posted video about the strange bug causing weird lines. I have no way of knowing.,dorothyfan1,Nothing specific. But there is a badly needed feature I posted a while back about why Goodnotes was starting to “slip”. Noteshelf 2 has a feature I’m hoping Goodnotes copies very soon. And this is a guide line built into the zoom box allowing you to write in a straight line on blank paper templates. Because currently when you write on blank paper with no lines it’s difficult to judge if the line you make is straight or not. And when you finish writing it usually ends up looking crooked. This feature improvement would help. And this doesn’t need a major feature update to hold off til a version 6 is released but could be released now.,1586515514

But there’s another reason a guide line becomes useful and that is adjusting the line height of the line so you write in the space of the line which artificially increases the size of the note and therefore uses up more of the page than if the width of the text were smaller.,1586558780

Published: Jun 04, 2021

SACRAMENTO – California Governor Gavin Newsom released the following statement on today’s court decision regarding assault weapons:

“Today’s decision is a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent Californians, period. As the son of a judge, I grew up with deep respect for the judicial process and the importance of a judge’s ability to make impartial fact-based rulings, but the fact that this judge compared the AR-15 – a weapon of war that’s used on the battlefield – to a Swiss Army Knife completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this weapon. We’re not backing down from this fight, and we’ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives.”

California has led the nation in passing gun safety laws, having pioneered statewide protections approved by voters in Proposition 63 to ban possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring background checks to keep ammunition out of the hands of dangerous people. Since assuming office, Governor Newsom has signed multiple bills aimed at reducing gun violence, including strengthening gun violence restraining orders and regulating the sale of firearms and ammunition. Governor Newsom also worked with the Legislature to accelerate the regulation of ‘ghost guns’ to crack down on the use of untraceable firearms by criminals. Because of California’s commitment to meaningful gun safety laws, the state has one of the lowest firearm injury death rates in the country.",1622869165

g1u13y,6,GoodNotes Writing &amp; Erasing Buggy,Question - iPad,"I've been using GoodNotes 5 for a couple of months now and have been noticing some strange artifacts when writing and erasing.

Whenever I'm zoomed in and writing small letters or mathematical symbols, it looks like GoodNotes sometimes attempts to ""smooth out"" my writing causing half of the mark I just made to curl up or disappear.

Example:  [https://i.imgur.com/boG2Biq.gif](https://i.imgur.com/boG2Biq.gif)  (notice how the bottom of the + sign gets abruptly cut off after writing it)

Then, recently I noticed that occasionally when I attempt to erase something, the text shifts or ""ghosts"" while the eraser tool is down on the page. ie. random marks appear on the screen that can't be erased, or weird effects happen with erasing.

Has anyone else experienced these issues and can suggest fixes?

When I realized I didn't have to do that I had a ""awwww yeahhh"" reaction. 

I did however like the changes to infantry ammo and the fact that you could build ammo resupply points on objectives. You could argue its the same thing but that never bothered me for some reason.

I’m editing to add this because based on your topless comment I think you’re seriously missing the point but I’ll use your example. It’s not about women being legally allowed to walk around topless because men can, it’s about it being SAFE to.

Colors get mixed. If you use a highlighter over, for example, blue ink, you'll prpbably change the color of the ink to a darker tone or even almost black. 

They are useless in black or dark pages because they also get mixed with the background :D.

Personally, I think Notability (now)  handles highlighters the best. It doesn't overlap over the colors (nor covers them as it used to do) and since they are in some kind of intermidiate cape, they still work on black templates and keep the color of the ink unchanged",1588294363

Today, while I was working on my notes, I had notifications that the storage is full and I should empty my trashcan (I honestly dont know if this is the correct word for it, but I use the german version and its basically trashcan in it). I did so and the took a look into my system settings and it said that Goodnotes is taking up 23GB of storage! I then checked my goodnotes backup, which I keep in my onedrive and all the files are only 1.7GB big.

I restarted my iPad and in the system settings it said that Goodnotes is now only taking up 1.7GB of space.

I had all my files being automatically backed up to google drive, and eventually noticed that the notebook of slides would not be backed up at all, and would just be excluded from the upload queue. Adding it back into the queue would fail again and then cause the app to crash. 

Eventually I realized that the file size of that notebook was around 270MB. 

The only way I could get the notebook to successfully back up was to export it as a flattened pdf, and on my laptop I used the “compress PDF” feature on Adobe Acrobat. The reduced file size was 8MB. Then I uploaded it into drive and downloaded it into GoodNotes. After deleting the original notebook, the file would be backed up just fine. Since I had to make a flattened PDF, I could no longer edit any previous annotations, but at least I didn’t have to worry about having a backup :/",1589199936

Today, while I was working on my notes, I had notifications that the storage is full and I should empty my trashcan (I honestly dont know if this is the correct word for it, but I use the german version and its basically trashcan in it). I did so and the took a look into my system settings and it said that Goodnotes is taking up 23GB of storage! I then checked my goodnotes backup, which I keep in my onedrive and all the files are only 1.7GB big.

I restarted my iPad and in the system settings it said that Goodnotes is now only taking up 1.7GB of space. 

I was happy and thought that the problem is solved.

But now I worked on my notes again for maybe 90 minutes and now Goodnotes takes up 10GB again.

I dont know what to do to solve this problem, so I hope maybe one of you can help me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance!",idonutcarrotall_,"Hello :)

another little Update:

I got a response from the Goodnotes support team, but sadly it wasn't helpful at all. It just said, that the Backup Size doesn't reflect the actual size of Goodnotes and that the actual size also includes ""other stuffs like caches, app sources, indexing data, trashed items and also exported library/PDF files"" - well, I feel like that doesn't really explain a difference of more than 20GB.

They also adviced me to clean up my storage in general, delete/offload unused apps. I already had this option activated and - apart from that - goodnotes still takes up &gt;20GB.

&amp;#x200B;

But some of you mentioned that it might be a problem with the backup. So yesterday evening I disabled the autobackup to Onedrive. I hope that this doesn't cause me problems one day, but since my notes also sync via iCloud on all my devices I think that I will survive without Auto-Backup. 

Immediately after I disabled the autobackup the Appsize was down to 1GB and didn't increase so far.

So maybe this is the solution and Goodnotes should definitely fix their Autobackup.

I'll keep you updated :)

Have a nice day!",1589284382

I’m most likely going to be buying an iPad for university (going into second year), and would use goodnotes. I’m just trying to figure out if 32 gb is enough, or if I’d need the 128. 

How much storage do your notes take up?

GoodNotes takes up a lot of storage, I used it to summarize my biology notes for my final exams in highschool and I think it uses a bit less than 1gb? But biology was only about 20 sites. 

If you add a lot of pictures, it get‘s very full soon, not going to lie! 

But if you‘d sent them to your computer anyways, maybe have an own harddrive - 32gb should be enough as well :)",1590379156

I haven't looked into it very heavily but I believe the cause of the issue is due to cracks that form in the cylinder walls. 

Ford hasn't issued any official recall or anything for it but as of pretty recently there are some [class action lawsuits](https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2021/ford-ecoboost-engine-problems-class-action-lawsuit.shtml) underway for it.

Early game I'd occupy temple of addioth, so that you can bait the beastmen that you're at war with to go there, and the other beastmen tribe will likely declare war on you and attack it too. You can get khatep to wipe out whichever beastmen faction attacks temple. You can attack khatep after he's weakened and use his city as a sack city if you want, but I winded up maintaing a trade and NAP with him til he was destroyed by alith anar later in the game. You can try to avoid war with Malekith by rushing venom glade--&gt;clar karond around lvl 10-11 so you can get your dragon quest done, but he'll likely declare war on you anyway, in my game he did but he never pushed past venom glade because of alith anar. once you got the dragon go back and heal the witchwood, from there i'd recommend going to oreon's camp for an easy confederation, NAP with clan mors by going to war with the dwarves to your east, raze their city, wait for deeproots to go to the forest near thorgrim and start farming greenskins to get the dwarves to like you. By about this time turn 35-40 I was able to confederate all of athel loren and like 20-25 turns later heal the oak of ages and finish the short victory on legendary.

Anyone knows what is the problem and how to solve this?",Question - iPad,,AutoModerator,"Your submission has been automatically removed because it only has a title and little to none self text.   
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion &amp; Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

**Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/history&amp;subject=I%20expanded%20my%20post&amp;message=I%20expanded%20my%20submission%20for%20your%20review%3A%20https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/nso5cn/10_most_unknown_facts_about_india_that_will/) once you have expanded your post so we can approve it for you.**

gwpt70,1,GoodNotes 5 PDF Problems When Visualized on Windows 10/Android?,,"Has anyone else had problems with deleted dots when visualizing GoodNotes 5 PDF exports/auto-backups in Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 or Android phones? I'm currently using GoodNotes 5 (version 5.4.26, most recently) on my iPad Air 1, and I've noticed that visualizing GoodNotes PDF's in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge always ignores small dots (e.g. the dots in i's and j's, periods, colons). This occurs regardless of whether I visualize the PDF's in the browser directly or via a file sharing service like DropBox, and I've noticed this rendering issue on both my and my friend's Windows 10 laptops.

However, I do notice that the dots are properly included when I visualize the PDF's in Internet Explorer, Adobe Reader, or just directly on my iPad Air 1 (which are either more intensive PDF applications/which use Apple's PDF renderer). That means that the dots are there, just not visualized in Chrome/Edge. I know Google Chrome/Chromium's PDF engine doesn't implement the entire Adobe PDF specification, but has anyone else ran into this issue? Are there any solutions (or does GoodNotes 4 have this issue)?

Recall Number
98V231000


&gt;&gt;Recall Date
09/22/1998 


&gt;Component
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM:WIRING:FRONT UNDERHOOD
**Summary**
VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: SEDAN, COUPE AND WAGON PASSENGER VEHICLES EXCEPT THE DX MODEL AND MODELS WITH V6 ENGINES. THE FACTORY INSTALLED AIR CONDITIONER WIRE HARNESS WAS IMPROPERLY ROUTED ALLOWING SOME WIRES TO RUB AGAINST EACH OTHER, EVENTUALLY CAUSING A SHORT CIRCUIT.


&gt; **Consequence**

&gt; THE SHORT CIRCUIT CANPOSSIBLY CAUSE THE UNDERHOOD WIREING TO OVERHEAT AND SMOKE, CAUSING A FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. A SHORT CIRCUIT CAN ALSO RESULT IN A BLOWN FUSE OR DEAD BATTERY.

The conspirator in me wants to say it was covered up after they learnt of the cause, but more likely is the case of a shoddy police investigation - car fire lines up with the injuries - teeth exposed to high temperatures (~4-700 degrees) will crack/fragment, cars reach up to 900 in a fire. I'd say that if there was a car fire (likely), the burns reported seem to underplay the severity a person would expect from a car fire (probably also just poor police work).

I wanted to organize by chapters/units to make my life a little easier and convenient.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",Inadover,"You have the option for creating an schema for the notebook, if that's what you're asking for.

 In the top left corner, next to the arrow you'll see a button made of 4 squares (I'll call that button the ""Page View"", for future reference). Press it. Then click on the downwards arrow of any page and select ""add page to the schema"" (or something like that), it will ask you to put a name and you're done.

Alternatively, on the top right corner, on the menu that appears after pressing the 3 dots you can select ""add this page to the schema"" too. I can send you a vid if needed.

After this, in the Page View, you'll have 3 tabs on the top. Thumbnails/pages, Favs and **Schema** or whatever name it has in english.",1591729567

h8pxv5,1,App laggy due to photos,Question - iPad,"   Recently I’ve began to explore using goodnotes to journal. However, one thing I noticed is that adding photos to a page makes it insanely laggy—it’ll take up to 2 minutes to load that one page, and even after it’s loaded I can’t move stuff around too much or the page will go blank again. 

   Had anyone else faced this problem, and how did you get around it?",dorothyfan1,What specs is your iPad? I'm curious about this because I'm beginning to suspect the lagging issues may be due to the fact that the iPad models currently out there don't have enough internal memory to handle heavy loads. If that same document you have could be put on a theoretical Windows machine with plenty of memory this lagging issue would disappear. Or even an iMac Pro. If the iMac Pro ever goes touch enabled like the iPad...you could say goodbye to the iPad. So I double Apple will do this as it appears they're trying to replace the iMac Pro with the iPad Pro with the introduction of the new keypad.,1592149393

That will be further exacerbated should RTX 30 series cards become unprofitable for mining (due to ASICS or a drop in crypto prices)

Using your own words: "" we don't have to know what they do in their bed, okay ?""

Why grant an Arab man with a childbride  who had no choice in the matter a shred of privacy out of 'decency' but protest  against what consenting adults do behind closed doors? Hypocrisy much? 

If you don't like Muhammad being reduced to his sex life because it's disrespectful, but LGBTs are reduced to their sex lives  and not whole human beings?

Why the fuck do Malaysians in South East Asia have to love a Middle Eastern figure except that their nenek moyang decided at some point to change their beliefs , and you , their descendant (probably), were raised in that imported Middle Eastern belief?

 IRONICALLY , you have even less rights to religious freedom than your ancestors because now our fucked up constitution made up a silly story about how you have to be Muslim to be Malay ( Le bullshit) that a lot of folks think of as a 'fact' carved in stone.

I don't think Aisha as a historical figure, was any saint or possessed any particular intelligence. She instigated civil war after the death of her husband, participated in tribal politics and caused the death of many people .

 She was also accused of adultery with a younger man , and honestly, being married off to an old man with a swarm of other women , it's no surprise that so many took it to be a fact. Her only cop out was Muhammad himself plucking a verse to save her reputation and ass ( since the penalty for Zina is death).

But I am totally aware of how for most Malaysian Muslims it's a sin to even THINK badly of her , so meh , RIP critical thinking.",1622869455

hf63oh,0,Palm rejection bug?,,,TheSuperior123,"So, this happens on my new ipad pro 4th gen and apple pencil 2. I am new to goodnotes.

When I want to write something, ( think it happens when I used my finger to touch the other buttons onscreen before writing) my palm gets detected like on video and moves the screen or zooms the page. This only happens rarely but still annoying.

When I write, my palm sits on the screen before pencil is on screen.

hhuy5l,1,Goodnotes vs Notability vs Noteshelf,Question - Other,"I’m a first year pre nursing student and decided I wanted to go paperless to see how I liked it. I recently bought a MacBook and iPad Pro to help with my studies. Because of COVID my classes are online however, once it’s over I’ll return to in person. I’ve been watching a lot of reviews on YouTube but still can’t decide between these apps. I really don’t want to have to use 2 apps because I’d feel less organize. Some of the features I want are:

• the ability to import slides and annotate them ( preferably with the three lines at the side) 
• the majority of my books are ebooks so I’d like to be able to annotate those as well
• I’m taking a lot of science classes so I’d want to draw diagrams and trace pictures 
• user friendly",adlibquorum,"I both have Notability and Goodnotes, so I can answer for them.

Notability: NTs ink flow and shape tools superior to GNs. I find NTs filing system much more useful than GNs (especially better if you take a lot of notes). This application much more suited for class notes and quick notes. Most of the users (especially in r/notabilityapp) having problems with the developer team's lack of consistent updates.

Goodnotes: You have to take your time to make your handwriting pretty. However, your end product looks really good. Highlighting tool is still superior. Shortcuts like different pen colors, auto-deselect eraser and quick access to photos makes whole writing experience much more fluid. 

Overall, I think both apps works great if it is suited to your study and note taking aims. None of the apps currently has hyperlinking option. You can check out other typed note apps like r/RoamResearch for that. One thing about working with PDF slides that [if you have LaTeX knowledge you can use this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/notabilityapp/comments/fx1ota/importing_pdfs_eg_slides_from_a_powerpoint_or/) Otherwise, both apps works pretty well with any presentation file.",1593419592

While I have no doubts that Apple will eventually be able to pull off something great with their own silicon design in Macs, I am very skeptical that v1 of their machines will actually make many performance improvements (we might see dramatic differences in battery life, however).

Besides, I severely doubt the OP has the time to wait for Apple to release their first ARM Mac, since I wouldn't be surprised at all if they wait until October like normal.

You don't have to, it's pretty clear what you are. 

&gt; And that’s not a defense, nor is it a defense when BLM does it or MAGA does it in Oregon or at the Capitol.

No no fella, unless you can show where you spoke out against blm/antifa violence in the past, you don't get to say shit about Jan 6th.  But I really really doubt you did.   But hey,  maybe I'm wrong. 

&gt; You’re as bad as they are. 

Sorry fella, I've condemned both, not that the two are in any way the same.   Maybe if the folks on Jan 6th burned down DC, caused billions in damages and killed a few dozen innocent people, we could talk about the two being the same. 
 But the whole point is if you didn't condemn the one, you do not get to condemn the other. Try to keep up.

Goodnotes had iCloud sync problem saying ""App version out of date. Please upgrade to the latest version"" even though in the app store it is updated to the latest version. By this time, there was still the blue dot for resizing textbox when it is selected. 

I decided that it's some kind of glitch and reinstall the app. The iCloud error message was gone, and the blue dot was also gone.

**What the issue is exactly:**

The blue dot does not appear when the textbox is created and when the existing textbox is selected.

When I copy and paste the text and make a duplicated text box, it gives two blue dots on the left and right sides. But when deselect the duplicated textbox and select it again, the dots are gone again.",1594725435

# Guy's I've found the solution as Goodnotes emailed me back:

Update Goodnotes to the version 5.4.35.

The bug, at least for me, appeared when it was on Goodnotes 5.4.34.

For some reason, I can't find the 5.4.35 update in the update section in the app store where all the other app updates are managed. [You have to go to the very specific Goodnotes app page of the app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602). (It won't say ""update"" even on the search page.)

I sometimes see slightly off ones in some digital notebook stuff and it so gets to me. I am testing out noteshelf and goodnotes myself.

i0695e,1,Exporting- PDFs are Blank?,Question - iPad,"I’m trying to export my journals from GoodNotes to a PDF file, but it always ends up with blank pages!

I’ve tried exporting the PDF from GoodNotes as a flattened file or an editable file, and tried opening them in my Google Drive, or using Acrobat, and they are always empty. Just the cover and the pages- but none of the other content! I use GoodNotes for journaling- so it’s just lots of my writing and an image here and there, nothing fancy.

I’d like to have my journals backed up as a PDF (that I can actually read!), so any help would be appreciated. Everything I could find online was not helpful or for GoodNotes 4.

I’m using GoodNotes 5.4.36 on an iPad Pro running iOS 13.6

If you want the stroke size to be consistent, you will have to use the Ball Pen.

Another thing you could try to do is keep your zoom consistent by double tapping the screen to make the page fit to screen. While the zoom should theoretically not change the size of your strokes, your pressure does naturally change with the zoom (as you will have to write bigger) and thus it will come out differently.",1596434353

A better example of the kind of posts we were trying to go for would be like [this one about improving our communication skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaneteerHandbook/comments/g93klo/communication_skills/) since that's definitely been a big stumbling block for me when it comes to environmental outreach, but we've had people make a variety of post types which I feel gives the place some decent balance :)",1622869638

So I am left Handed and have constant wrist pain, so I am always looking for something that will make me to things faster. I saw and old post here where someone built a custom Bluetooth Keyboard but me not being super useful with my hands I decided to look in the internet and see if I could find something that I liked and was functional.

Found those tiny Macropads where you can easily modify the keys with key combinations and that looked great. while navigating google images to see different models I found one with a Knob! a KNOB!! that is genius, sadly it seemed like it was a version that was out of stock navigated reddit to see if someone had a used one. Finally found a guy that made them, I asked him tons of questions such as if it would work with an ipad and was it hard to program etc.

He sent me videos and tutorials I said yeah why not. let's do it, I am not a techie person so setting up the whole thing so I could program the keyboard took me 2 hours, got the keypad today, flashed the file I did, it works like a charm. it is not fancy like the bluetooth one, but it uses USB C, and I just used a short one I had laying there (USB c to USB C)

We also have full custody of the kids so they live with me and rely on DH and me for EVERYTHING. BM only visits with them 3 times a year, at most. On one of her sporadic visits, I once texted SD to remind her of something and BM went off on DH via text saying that I didn't need to be texting the kids about things and if we needed something that he (DH) could contact her (BM). She ignores his messages even more than the kids do which is why we usually send reminders directly to the kids. I later learned from youngest SS that BM lost it and started yelling at the kids about me texting with them. She, once again, manipulated them into thinking that they hurt her simply by replying to me. She also checks their phones when they are with her so they feel the need to ""protect her feelings"" by pretending they always ignore me. I now completely understand why they don't respond to texts. SD still texts me for literally everything any other time of the year, but she goes ghost when with BM. Oldest SS is even more loyal to his mom and only texts me when he needs something because he's bought into her BS and thinks that he can't even be civil with me or any member of my family without betraying her.",1622869665

The only hyperlinks are from imported PDFs which is where you see all the planner apps etc incorporating them so they can click on a tab and go to that page.   
At the moment, you can’t click on any URL text, it is simply text. I’m hoping they include it in an upcoming feature that they’re hinting about on beta. 

The way I’ve been getting around it is to use an ‘open in safari’ shortcut from the shortcuts app. It’s clunky though, you have to select the text tool, then manually select the text then share button and invoke the shortcut that way.",1596966645

Swipe down on menu and ""turn sensors off""

Now Gible will always be centered on your screen and you will skip the zoom out animation.",1622869716

THANK YOU!,,,roguepermutations,"Someone once told me that ther are cultures in which the onus is on the speaker to communicate fully and accurately — certainly the case in the US occupied territories — and others in which the onus is on the listener. I think ther example was Japan. That really stuck with me and I have tried to do my best in both roles since hearing that. 
I’m obviously not saying that it’s acceptable to communicate in ways that aren’t complete or accurate. My point is more that we are all accountable to each other in both roles. And that cultural differences are interesting and run deep in ways that are sometimes surprising to me.",1622869716

You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/R4Rstralia, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/R4Rstralia/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FR4Rstralia).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

ic9w8b,1,I made some composition-style notebook covers and I wanted to share them with you all. Every cover has two styles. One with a semi-opaque text box and one without.,Templates,,swimgirl566,"It’s actually pretty easy. 

First I look through Pinterest for cool pictures (preferably pics for phone wallpapers). Then I open a new canvas on Procreate and I change the canvas size to the size of the cover (A4, A3, GoodNotes standard, etc.) and I draw a black line on the left side roughly 1 inch thick. 

And then add a new layer underneath and import a photo. Move the photo until you like the way it covers the rest of the canvas. 

After that, I exported the canvas as a jpeg into keynote on my laptop. That way when I’m making multiple, I can ensure the text box and the size of the cover stays the same. 

I change the size of the keynote to the same size as on procreate and I drag the new picture, with the black strip, to the middle where the guides help pop the picture to the middle. I add the rounded rectangle and eyeball it until I’m satisfied with where it is. 

And than I go to the top and hit file, then export to images and than you’re done! It should appear in a “documents” folder in your iCloud Drive. 

Sorry for the long paragraph. Hope this helps. :) :)",1597815569

ii5wzz,1,Japanese Verb Conjugation Practice Notebook,Templates,[removed],MacReadyROG,"i think that might just be the reddit algorithm. don't take it personally -- i've seen it happen in other reddits as well.

from my perspective there seem to be three camps: 

1. those who go ""by the book"": Windows Updates, swearing by drivers ONLY supplied via MyASUS, and using the ASUS Recovery for fresh re-installations. i think these are generally those who choose stability vs. max battery and performance 
2. those who go ""by the book"" except to disable Boost in the Registry (from the sticky)
3. those who follow the stickied posts for Ultimate Battery Life, which also entails using latest non-ASUS-approved drivers direct from Nvidia, AMD, Dolby, etc. after a totally fresh install of Windows, etc.

fwiw, i'm #2 and have ZERO issues with stability, performance, etc. since i got the G14. stuff you might have read about colour tones switching, or freezes, or black screens, or loss of Dolby, or out of control temps -- i have experienced none of that.

i'm plugged into the wall 98% of the time and use the G14 for work primarily. i game a bit, but am still working on titles that are 5 years old. so extended battery life and increased performance is not a concern for me.

what i did, out of the box:

\- re-install Windows from ASUS Recovery  
\- tweaked Windows how i like it, incl uninstalling bloatware, setting up partitions, power settings, etc.  
\- Windows Updates until there were none  
\- MyASUS software updates  
\- Armoury Crate software updates  
\- disabled boost via Registry  
\- installed work apps  
\- got to work

a couple of BIOS updates have popped up since:  
\- BIOS 406 (some have reported issues with 407, so i've not bothered with that)

The idea is to break out of the perfectionist mindset and just put pen to paper. It's a lot of fun.

The event attracts a lot of children, whose comics are incoherant at the best of times, but should be encouraged to continue nonetheless. As coming up with ideas on the fly is difficult, they're often inspired by whatever cartoons or video games are popular at the time. 

There's a retrospective issue in the works, and I've been tasked with scanning some of the more interesting comics from the pre-digital days, according to my own discretion. I wouldn't normally include something like this, but as you surely can imagine, I just had to.",1622869772

If each of the people who own those 20 shares vote, there will be 20 votes cast representing 10 shares!

The before version colored only the strokes

However, you can make a case for why you should be given a chance to come back after a year (explaining that you did bad due to issues outside your control like mental/physical health or whatever the case may be and how you'll be  fixing your problems while you're gone). I did this and they allowed me to come back to UBC after a year *without* reapplying. Knowing I could come back a year later without the uncertainty of not knowing if I'd be accepted or not allowed me to focus on improving my health and be less stressed about the situation. So I'm honestly so thankful I talked to them and actively pursued some kind of arrangement, even though at the time I thought it was pointless and they'd never give me the kind of deal they luckily agreed to.

I'm not sure how common my scenario is but I wanted to suggest that it is definitely worth talking to them and doing the appeal if they ask you to (but only if you do it with an explicit plan mentioned to show that you're serious about addressing the issues and coming back in a better state).",1622869843

In my defense, every God damn time before that that I had pulled the trigger before the safety was depressed it locked the God damn safety in position and I ruined more fucking trim that way...and when I go to show my boss why I don't like the safety? FML.

iueigw,1,How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5?,Question - iPad,"**TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen?",Eating_Well73,"I'm a PhD student and have imported 10-15 books, 70 (so far) articles and book chapters, several notebooks for notetaking (about 100 pages each), probably 30 annotated PDF lectures on my iPad. Once I import any PDF into Goodnotes, the app saves it in the .goodnotes format. And I save and backup all files in the Goodnotes format.  I only export my notes to PDF for storage on Dropbox once I'm satisfied that doc needs no further edits.  Using this method, I'm at 8GB of storage.  However, if Goodnotes adds audio recordings (I can only dream), then I can imagine my library size swelling.

I was kidding myself when I said I would use only Goodnotes on the Ipad.  It turns out Dropbox (for backing up), Procreate (to aid with diagrams) and the Iphoto library (where my screenshots from lecture material or internet go), Notability, and Anki take up another 30 gigs easily.  

I've never experienced a lag on the ipad (except when certain PDF books were graphics intense).  Keep it organised from the start and the incremental backups, won't take long. You've already invested so much in law school already, just spend a few more hundred and never have to worry about this again.  Good luck",1600366509

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen?",allevana,"So helpful, thanks so much! Some of the textbooks are really long (1k pages) but those ones aren't graphics heavy, just fat slabs of text, and then all my anatomy textbooks are full of pictures and diagrams but I only use one per semester so I'll be able to move the ones I don't need off the device if need be. I think it'll end up being okay. And my slide decks are provided by the University in .pdf format so that's really good! I'm glad the iPad doesn't lag too much once it's full",1600392923
iueigw,1,How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5?,Question - iPad,"**TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol.

So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen?",allevana,"Thank you so much for this, I hadn't even considered that GN goes though iCloud.. I had an old apple ID when I was quite a bit younger and iCloud's free 15GB filled up so quickly with just photos. And yes I did want my iPad and MBA to talk to each other the same way OneNote syncs across all my devices. I think I would have run into the full cloud storage issue much quicker with OneNote but my institution gives 1TB storage to all students and that's why I haven't noticed things filling up. Seriously thanks 100x for letting me know",1600393120

- BBA asks if any of the boys have ever seen the ocean before, Homer says to Renata that he’s never seen the ocean before

- The dancers around Renata switch sides from when Hap first meets her compared with his memories of the event as he’s working out how to break the Haptives’ rebellion

- The same two boys walk on opposite sides of Steve in the high school locker room during his phone conversation with Prairie, they seem to enter the showers twice.

- French wears a very similar outfit to Homer’s Cuba attire at the ending cafeteria scene

- Numerous things Prairie says about her past, as well as things that happened after Hap left her, are later applied to the C5 throughout Part 2 (Her friend was going to Chicago, BBA has a layover in Chicago. She mentions a Greyhound bus, which they travel in. She mentions being picked up by an old woman in a dusty car. She talks about how she disappeared (much like the police briefly shown interrogating Buck’s mom after they ran away with BBA and an AMBER alert is issued). 

- Leon mentions a janitor coming into the hospital wing, and that he locks the doors. Karim poses as a janitor at CURI and fails to get into a locked room. 

- Hap says to Leon “I want to taste the truth”, which seems to reference him doing just that in Part 2 when he eats the flower stem.

- Hap taking out August to bury her, then doing the same with Rachel. Similarly when Rachel attacks him and he throws her on the floor, it mirrors the same events leading up to Prairie’s second NDE.

- Hap removes seeds from people’s brains in Part 2, whereas in Part 1, he was inserting mics in their ears in the water tank. The mics look similar to the stem he eats.

iumslp,1,A measuring tool in Goodnotes?,,Noteshelf 2 came up with a cool add on yesterday - a measuring tool built into the lasso tool. So when you rotate text in Noteshelf there is this measuring tool that precisely tells you what angle the handwritten text is in. Goodnotes simply lets you rotate the text but doesn’t tell you how precisely the angle your handwritten notes is. I hope Goodnotes is watching this and learning from the competition. I think this measuring tool idea is brilliant and kudos to Noteshelf 2 for introducing this in yesterday’s release.,jofkoch,You can post your suggestions [here](https://feedback.goodnotes.com/forums/191274-customer-suggestions-for-goodnotes),1600378989

Thank you for your time!",randomaussie9730,"I used both, right now mostly good notes. Here’s what I like about GN5 compared to notability: 
- Better folder system 
- better pen personalization (can finely adjust thickness) 
- better zoom auto advance 
- my handwriting looks better 
- better paper templates and sizes 
- outline of imported PDFs 

And here’s what I wished they copied from notability: 
- voice recording (very hardly used but still nice to have) 
- import scanned document as image not as pdf
- change paper template for all pages in a document 
- change/edit pen thickness of selected text 

I used notability primarily for the past 2 years but recently got really annoyed with the paper template; the line spacing is either too narrow or too big, there’s no in between. Same issue for the pen thickness setting. It’s either too thin or too thick. Plus notability was getting messy with more than 800 notes their file system was just not enough.",1600505818

ixvymq,1,GoodNotes 5 Plam Rejection and Apple Pencil,Question - Other,[removed],pebkachu,"Exactly! I recently see so many passive-agressive posts on some social media sites - gladly, not on Reddit - implying that any other identity for the Vessels than non-binary is invalid and transphobic.  
(I wanted to make a post about this, would that be an insensitive thing to do during Pride Month? I understand that non-binary people are happy about representation and can get protective about this, but that doesn't imply that the former behaviour is okay, I even saw other enbies on Twitter saying this claim goes too far. Even Team Cherry admits to sometimes fall back to ""he"" unintentionally. They might indicate that they originally designed and mentally still perceive the Knights as rather leaning to the male spectrum, but their canonical genderlessness stands and they support non-binary interpretations nonetheless.)

India is a mostly Hindu country. They are therefore mostly vegetarians, so scope for more consumption of meat is limited there. The bigger problem is actually China where meat consumption has rocketed and they aren't fussy about where it (or it's feed) comes from.

There are public policies that could help. Better education on health and nutrition, eliminating subsidies on production and stricter controls on imports. This would make meat a lot less economically viable.

If you can cut its appeal and it's economic viability, supply will fall.",1622869961

We have one stadium with capacity of 60,000 that needs massive renovations to be ""WC ready"", but it'll do. Another one has a capacity of 40,000, but is new so I suppose no renovations needed. Another one has a stadium with 34,000 and seems like it'll be renovated soon and will hold 40,000 so that'll be good. And that's it. We have 3 other ""larger stadiums"" with capacity at around 25,000, so ""renovations"" wouldn't cut it. ""Okay"", you say, ""we have three stadiums though"", except they're all in the same city, which under FIFA rules can't host more than a certain number of games. So, we have 1 stadium that's usable.

We also don't have great bus system, we'll need maybe 100-200 new buses to support the influx of people. There's no metro, so everyone will move around by bus. 

Also, there'd be a shortage of hotels I think since we don't get nearly the amount of tourists we'd get with a World Cup, so maybe we build a few hotels.

Our airport also only has 8 gates, so it may need some rebuilding too.

Oh, and we definitely don't have enough money for security or emergency services.

It's not that hosting it in Uruguay goes against this idea of not having diversity, it's just impossible. We could *maybe* participate if it's primarily hosted in Argentina/Paraguay/Brazil, but we can't really do much more than contribute with a singular atadium (that isn't even technically allowed to host anything more than the QF since it's so small). 

It doesn't have to be only Europe or the US, but Uruguay is possibly one of the least prepared places to host it in all of South America (I'd say Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela are all much more prepared - maybe Bolivia and Paraguay are right there with us). We are a tiny country with one large city (1.5 million) and less than 10 small ones (50,000-100,000).",1622869961

- I use the ballpoint pen in size 0.35mm, which works out really nice and it’s around the size of my fine liners IRL 
- I use the zoom window, bc the advance ahead feature helps keep my writing consistent bc if I zoom out and move to another area the tilt of my writing is wayyyyy different lol

We can’t see the credit, though, I’ll give the girl the benefit of the doubt that she didn’t do that.
Still, it’s a shame she couldn’t have added something to the sketch, done her own spin as opposed to just lip syncing.

I dunno it's a fun experience, everyone having a good time!

Thanks in advance",Vicious-the-Syd,"I already said that it was based on honor code in my first reply to you. I am aware of how it works and that we can’t check vaccination status. But just because someone can get away with something doesn’t make it right. It is unethical for someone to pretend to be vaccinated so that they don’t have to wear a mask. There are multitude of reasons why someone might not be fully vaccinated: maybe they’re too young, maybe they are waiting on their second dose, maybe it hasn’t been two weeks since their last dose, maybe there’s a medical reason why they can’t get it, maybe they had covid and received that treatment where you have to wait three months before you can get the vaccine. It’s not our business to know why someone might not be fully vaccinated, but when you come into my store pretending like you’re vaccinated when you aren’t, that makes you an asshole. Either get vaccinated and don’t wear a mask or don’t get vaccinated and wear a mask.",1622869992

When I search for a single number like 1 or 3 nothing comes up.  I searched for a word next to the number - and it does recognize it as a number.  i.e.

1 love - search for 1 doesn't find it.  Search for love and the 1 shows up converted in the search.  So it definitely finds and transcribes numbers.

So then I tried writing a 12 as neatly as possible - boom it shows up - so somehow a single number or letter search doesn't work.  I also tried searching for the letter ""a"" - and that turned up nothing but ""an"" showed a bunch.

So maybe try writing 01 02 and 03 - I did that and the search found those.  And TBH I was doing my date numbering using Art Deco style - which look look cool but I didn't think handwriting recognition would find it.  But It did as long as I searched and had 2 numbers.",1602542502

j6uyxm,1,"""Your disk is almost full""",,"This year, I got an iPad air with 64 GB for the sole purpose of using it only for school. I take all my notes on goodnotes and have imported very large documents onto it, but it only takes up 4.84 of the 21.5GB used storage on my iPad. I backup my notes to my school OneDrive account because I like to view my annotated notes on my laptop while rewriting the notes on my Ipad. However, recently Goodnotes keeps saying my disk if full and recommends that I delete all the documents in my trash (which I've already done) several times in a minute. This happened about a week ago. At that time, the app also crashed and wouldn't let me go into it for a few hours, before I was able to go in and delete a huge folder and the pop-up disappeared for a few days, but now it's reappeared. Is there any way to fix it? I'm just scared because there are some notebooks that aren't backing up onto OneDrive and I am also very dependant on the app for school. Also, could anyone please tell my why I get the ""your disk is almost full"" notification when I still have over 40GB of free storage on my iPad.

j9hwji,1,Alignment and sizing help please,,"Hello Darlings!

I am wondering if someone can help me.

I am making a sticker book in GoodNotes but i am having issues with making the stickers the same size and keeping them lined up properly.

Each sticker is an individual png and is pre cropped so that people can move them freely. 

So im not able to align them somewhere else and save a whole page of stickers because they need to remain independent.

So when i drag a png and drop them in  GoodNotes they end up different sizes. 
( Even though they were created the same size. )

This makes them all look disheveled no matter how i try to make it look nice.

Is there a way to make the stickers the same size in Goodnotes?

Is there an alignment tool so i know everything is straight?

I hope this makes sense.

It's common for dissimilar languages to use the same alphabet/script, because what happens is some culture invents a written language, and then it gets introduced elsewhere where everybody agrees that's a great idea and copies the alphabet, without wanting to change their own language.

That's how I'd approach the way that script is shared between Dwarf and Primordial (I didn't know that!)  The fact that they share script doesn't mean that the languages are at all similar.  (Although like German and English, they might be.)",1622870071

The exact kind of workload a gpu does is very parallelized. Meaning many many things must happen all at the same time. Exactly that is what a cpu is bad at doing on a massive scale like that. And then it still also needs to execute the game code too.

For old games maybe someday. But for new new games with all kinds of very complex geometry and lighting and stuff. Probably not anytime remotely soon.  


Exactly this scenerio is why most Single Board Computers are not worth buying for Desktop use. They have a fair amount of cpu power. And they have a gpu.

jfsq7e,1,Notebook Covers,Templates,,SirBertLeaman,"I don't disagree with the majority of what you said, however, I do have a couple points I'd like to bring up. While I enjoy the Drive forms, I also still enjoy the gameplay when I'm not using them. Basic combat feels responsive and the player still has other options. I don't think the gameplay feels restrictive for them to be locked off here and there, especially if that's part of the challenge of the segment. ...And when it comes to the Pride Lands, you have to adopt entirely different gameplay mechanics anyway and that's always going to be up to the individual's tastes. KHIII has segments where the gameplay is entirely different for a time but it's woven into the gameplay pretty evenly to where it never becomes too noticeable; the pirate ship in the Caribbean, every world has some kind of minigame.

Another thing, KHIII absolutely gives you a ton of tools to use in battle but unfortunately their usefulness tends to vary. Apart from Critical difficulty, magic is pretty overpowered and gives the player little reason to use other tools unless you just want to for variety or to style on the enemies. The summons are pretty effective regardless. I feel like KHII encouraged you to use different abilities because different things were effective in different situations while KHIII has certain tools that are super effective throughout leaving the rest to languish. 

Similarly, arguably the most useful tools are locked into a system that as far as I know is still considered largely random. The meter you have to build with combos and magic to use the keyblade transformations and grand magic doesn't seem to fill uniformly and doesn't always give you what you're hoping for. On top of that, the attractions are an almost entirely random occurrence tied to attacking certain enemies. This is what's particularly frustrating for me. Like, these are tools I'd like more direct control over when I get to use them. Storing and swapping the keyblade transformations is super neat, even though I don't really care for the idea of the keyblade transforming in the first place.

Alot of it is going to come down to personal tastes, I think. KH games all have different play styles and gimmicks and it's kind of a toss-up if it's going to be what you're looking for. In my case though, I liked how KH2 built upon the original KH and expected the growth into KH3 to be along the same lines. I wasn't especially fond of the mechanics that the spin-off's introduced. I didn't hold it against those games because they were on systems that necessitated a more limited control scheme but I also wasn't expecting flowmotion and shotlocks to return in KH3.  


TL;DR It might just be a matter of taste and KH is all over the map with this stuff.",1622870113

Record: 1-0, last game postponed

USL Championship Soccer ⚽ - Indy Eleven vs. Memphis 901

**Indy Eleven ML @ 2.58 (+158)**, recommend HAMMER ~3 units

4pm PST

* I have a very very tasty game for you guys today. Bottom of the league Memphis will go up against the top ranked Indy Eleven in Indiana to try to reclaim some points. The problem? Brand new head coach and a Memphis team that has been gutted by players out on international duty WC qualifying and a red card suspension. Expect 17 year old academy players to be starting for Memphis tomorrow. While Indy has lost a player to international duty as well, they are in top form, sporting a great offense and a top 5 defense in the entire league. Indy should easily be the favorite in the matchup - i expect this line to drop significantly once oddsmakers readjust.

This is one of the best plays i've found in a while.

🐅🐅🐅

Edit: we broke the book again, boys. Line is down to 1.98 on my book. If you want to get in on this action late, I still like the bet all the way down to about 2.0. If it drops any further, I can no longer recommend this line. Good luck, guys!",1622870131

It’s a serious trouble ☹️",turtletreestar,"The holocaust probably wouldn’t have happened if people didn’t have ideas about Jews being greedy and getting “Jew’d”.  The history of prejudice towards them is long and ugly, and it’s ignorant and hateful of you to perpetuate that bigotry, even in a seemingly “harmless” way of using your freedom of speech and then angrily doubling down on it.  Just because I (and many others) point out the inherent prejudice in your speech, doesn’t mean we are trying to be a victim for other people. If a man is sexually assaulting a woman, and another man tells him to fuck off and that he is acting inappropriately, does that mean the man who is intervening is trying to be a victim? Or virtue signalling?

So, my question is this: how do you feel about Jewish people? If you don’t hate them, maybe consider that by equating being ripped off with Jewish people, you are perpetuating ignorant and harmful stereotypes. And instead of getting angry that people are trying to “regulate” your freedom of speech or way of thinking, maybe consider that there might be other forms of speech that function on a higher level, that can communicate what you are trying to say without being harmful, and will illicit better interactions with others.  You seem to think everyone here who is pointing out the ideological flaw in your choice of words is on some high horse, but maybe you fail to see your own high horse.  Anyway, someone who clings so hard to his right to be able to say derogatory things must be deeply insecure. Maybe you should look at that. Underlying trauma is a huge problem.

I'm looking for constructive things that actually benefit my time.  Time is scarce and life is short.

Not looking for emotional fights.  To even read them.  Fanboyism is barely on my radar, even though I acknowledge that it exists here and other places.  Occasionally it pops up and it's annoying.  I do check this place every day (usually) but maybe I'm instinctively not clicking on the dodgy ones?

My use case here is to keep up to date with AMD related news because I switched 2 years ago after 10 years with Intel.  No hate, I literally just care about multi core performance and better power consumption for long 100% usage workloads.  My last Intel CPU has been great and still works well to this day.  I now have 2 AMD systems and love that it's so easy to switch parts between the two for troubleshooting or upgrades, even if the parts are from different generations.

And also check to see what settings people are using, in terms of voltages, manual vs stock vs PBO.  Manual RAM timings, silicon lottery numbers (when people share their personal results after building the system).  I save a lot of these resources to my HDD for future reference.  And also.. when other people ask for help, if I know something, sharing that info and returning the favor.  Because when I first joined here, I knew pretty much nothing about the AMD way of optimizing the system.  With Intel I always used XMP, but with Ryzen you get better results by manually optimizing it yourself.  And people helped a lot in terms of sharing what they know.

I do agree with you.. that AMD users.. a large group of them do have a chip on their shoulder.  For many years their products were rubbish, and it's only been in the last few years that they've really transitioned into a competitive and now premium brand.  It used to be a value based budget option only.  Also.. in 20 years, the only CPUs I've ever had fail have been AMD.  But yeah, lately they have become really popular and more mainstream, and I have noticed a change here in the last 12 months.  But I rarely think of this place as toxic though, otherwise I would avoid it and find the resources elsewhere.

I don't understand the whole emotional side of the tech world.  Tech things are based on specs.  It's very robotic and mathematical.  I do care about anti competitive or anti consumer practices, but I've never understood the whole tribal thing in terms of Team Red vs Team Blue.  I use Samsung SSD's because I love their cloning software, the reliability and the speeds (not so much the prices, but if you buy during cashback periods it makes it easier).  It has nothing to do with being Team Black.

TLDR version.. I think what you might be talking about is a lot of AMD users have inferiority complex.  And a lot of NVIDIA and Intel users have superiority complex after dominating the market with superior high end products over the last 10+ years.",1622870174

Try writing without using zoom tool. Try putting a mark at the centre of the page. Then zoom until the point where you are comfortable with the width.

I wish they had a zoom option.  In notebook overview it helps to have larger text when you are scrolling through.  Your headings and numbers should be big enough to see in overview - the individual text probably not.

That being  said - you have the margin - if you follow the Cornell method you could make larger text with hints/questions there.  Another choice is to leave yourself room at the bottom for a summary (also Cornell method) and use larger text - so that when you are skimming you can get the gist of the page.",1604237034

jm8vz8,1,“Highlighter on top of text” issue respond from GoodNotes!,,"A few days ago I wrote an email to GoodNotes about highlighter being on top of my texts and especially making the text underneath look dull. 
If you searched for an answer and couldn’t find one, here’s their respond: 

“I'm afraid the highlighting stroke has always been on top. If you use a highlighter color that's transparent, then it will take a huge number of strokes to eventually block the text it highlights, thus giving the appearance that the highlighting is behind the text. But if you try using a highlighter color that's more opaque, it will take just a few strokes to eventually cover the text. That means highlighting strokes are always on the top layer.

On dark paper, the general brightness of the paper is now detected and the strokes are adjusted accordingly to increase their visibility. Previously, if you drew or highlighted a white stroke on dark paper, the stroke would be almost invisible until you erased it and we got a large number of complaints about it. I realize this change isn't ideal, especially to users like you, and we'll think about introducing a ""behind-text"" highlighting mode so that more users can benefit.

Technically speaking for light papers, it blends with the text rather than behind the text. It just looks like ""behind the text"" for the blended effect. For dark papers, due to the limitations of Apple blend mode, the behaviour on the dark paper is currently the best we have come up so far.”",dokina,"I do really like that the highlighters show up more on dark paper but this is still annoying because if I use dark paper with white pen, the highlight changes the color of the white writing to a light blue or whatever lol I really hope they can implement this 🤞",1604284972

But, for sure you'll need some time to get used to it (one/two weeks I'd say). It's normal to be slower and messier and the very beginning and the faster way to solve this is forcing yourself to use the iPad every time you can! So if your notes are a disaster at first, don't give up cause it will get a lot better! (and learn to use the zoom tool cause it's godsent and really helps with speed)

jsd0yd,1,Rejoice! New update allows undoing to remove the shape line instead of the highlight!,,,devil-wears-converse,"I wanted to share the contents of this update because I know a lot of people (including me) where a little muffed that a few updates ago removed a feature where we could could click undo to erase shape lines but keep the filled in highlight. This caused people to have to *carefully* use the eraser and barely touch the outside line of the shape without touching the highlight portion. This is going to make my life a hell of a lot easier. 


Full updates:

""This update adds some more improvements to the shape recognition as well as other bug fixes:

- added “require hold to snap” option to the shapes tool. Disable the option to let lines snap to other lines again automatically without having to hold down

- tapping undo after drawing a filled shape will remove the line first instead of the filling

- added support for resizing circles in a fixed ratio

- fixed glitches when erasing small ellipses

- fixed recurring sync error alerts

- fixed an issue that caused text boxes to be duplicated after modifying it with dismissed keyboard

- added some more stability improvements""",1605117911

Like we asked Goodnotes for pen sensitivity options? we got it.

Removing line instead of fill? we got it.

jvchnt,5,Zoom Out on the PDF document,,"Hello everybody!

I have a question regarding ""zoom out"" options in GoodNotes 5.

How can I zoom out to the extent that 2 pages will show at the same time? For example, on a mac, in the preview app, you can zoom out PDF documents as shown in the picture below. 

Is there such an option available in GoodNotes5? Do you know other apps that have this option?

It is important for me, because I like to see PDF docs as a ""whole"", I like to see the ""big picture"" of what is happening in my slides.

You know when stuff is shitty but you remember you have your significant other and even if everything else is shitty at least you've got your best friend? Its like that but not having the best friend anymore. It sucks. Shit happens and there is nothing you can do about it. Try to eventually take that lesson from it and realize that all kinds of tragedy are always a possibility. Try to build yourself up enough to realize that whatever happens it may suck but you will make it through it no matter what.

Thanks in advance",der_claaaas93,"You could open the window where you see all of the pages in that pdf document and then tap on the little arrow of a page and choose ""Open in new window"" (or something like that) and then that page will open as a split screen window next to your previous window.

Thanks in advance",IvanLasston,"Hopefully someone has a better answer but I don't know of anything in landscape to view side by side.

You could open 2 windows of GoodNotes and then run the two windows side by side. Kind of a pain as you'd have to scroll both windows.  

[Check out this GoodNotes support article on multiple windows on iPad.](https://support.goodnotes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001118635-Opening-GoodNotes-in-multiple-windows-on-iPadOS)

Have the same document open.  The windows scroll independently which is a pain if you are just reading through a PDF. 

You could also switch to Vertical scroll which would allow you to zoom out and see multiple pages.  

Contact GoodNotes - they do keep track of frequently requested features.  

I've found GoodNotes to be an excellent notebook replacement.  For use cases like studying from PDF - I like to use [MarginNote](https://www.marginnote.com).  [LiquidText](https://www.liquidtext.net) is another similar app but I find myself using MarginNote as I like the way it generates mind maps.",1605972477

jycxnn,1,Super laggy handwriting,,"Hey there

So I’ve been using Good Notes since April now and I never had problems with it. But since a few months I have this problem that handwriting is super laggy on my 2018 iPad. It’s not in any other writing app and my iPad in general is not slow. It is so bad that if I draw a line from one end to another in a quick motion and if I already have been drawing without taking the pen off the screen, it could take up to 20 seconds until the actual line arrives. It’s very annoying and really prevents me from using the app nicely.

Have you pasted much stuff or loaded a really big PDF?  Have you tried making a new notebook and seeing if it lags there?

I had a drawing glitch on my iPad on an earlier (this year) release.   What happened was I got extra lines drawn/lag.  It was a release or 2 ago - but it seems to be OK now.  (I.E. I'd draw didn't see something go back and draw again - then I'd have multiple lines show up). 

I run GoodNotes on all platforms.  (iPad, iPhone, Mac) and the other platforms I didn't experience the glitch - but I don't draw nearly as much on the iPhone or Mac.",1605996864

Keynote’s tables are super clean and fairly easy to customize and adjust colors, transparency, size, and so on. It just takes a bit of time to figure out what best works for you.

Seems like you’re not getting the PDF or something. The page size in a PDF is defined in its data, not by the nature of it being on the web or anything like that.

Edit: this appears to be an image or element from another source dropped in the middle of a page. Is that accurate? The canvas (borders, margin, whitespace) of a PDF can be larger than the visible content. That is what I bet is happening.",1606415730

I had surgery in the more pemissive period. Percocets made me psycho because they gave me insomnia and confused me so badly I didn't sleep for a week (and I can go with a lot of sleep)...I see pictures and my face was nearly grey.

So next surgery basically gave me something else that was morphine and I assume it is very addicting...

because I normally have insomnia I used it to sleep...scared of going crazy again.

It was a MOUNTAIN of pills. I did not feel anything when I stopped taking it....Once the pain was over--then I did not want it.

I mean--it constipates you! I'm surprised it causes so many people addiction....but pain is terrible.

I wonder about the psychological effects on people with chronic pain conditions.

Dependence on opiates is sort of a toss up for being worse than mind-numbing pain?

I don't get how people think about this when you're talking about people in hopeless crushing pain. Like...OK so you are 'hooked' but...is that worse?

I took a LOT for a long while...and was super happy at the sleeps it gave me which were he best sleeps....but I guess it doesn't suit me.

I think I have an addictive personality?

Anyway...the way the issue is approached is puzzling. Now people are resented for pain but pain is bad, right? So is it anyone's fault for wanting to avoid it? Is there anything  besides death that humans want to avoid more than physical pain?

Perhaps it is possible to become addicted from one generous prescription of opiates but pain seems bad also...

I'm very disturbed by the horrible stories I read about opiate addiction so I recognize how sad and terrible it is. But is there no way to medically manage the pain in some way that protects people? Why is this such a huge problem all of the sudden when there were decades where prescription opiates were not a huge problem?

Maybe the specific ones they have now?

And how depressing to ban kratom when this is a thing people take to get off opiate addiction.

It appears a matter of social control more than anything else. There are so many tragedies and yet you wonder if these could have been avoided with sympathetic medical care--but instead we brought the punishment hammer down.",1622870392

Next eliminate screen brightness or other misbehaving apps. 

Lastly, check for any bluetooth or network connection that is distant from the ipad - running with low sigal to a pencil across the room or speakers barely in range runs out the battery really fast.",1608230555

knuj11,1,custom cover problem,,,XF939495xj6,"This happens on the iPad because the native photos app from apple does not have the ability to size images by pixel dimension. So, any screen shot or image you save as a file or a photo is sized by the pixels it was in originally, no matter how large it displays on your screen.

To solve, you need to ensure the image is literally the number of pixels tall and wide as the template sheet of paper you are using. That will cause it to display properly. So, get an image editor that will resize images by dimensions instead of apple’s built in photos app which resizes to preserve image quality shrinking it as you crop it down.

That will make it line up.

Now, that said, let’s discuss your Apple Customer OCD problem for which there is no medication. There’s something about Apple customers in that they are completely over the top when it comes to tiny little details in things. Dead pixels, a screw not painted exactly the same shade as the surrounding shell, etc. 

You need to get over it. You aren’t looking at the cover when you take notes. The cover only displays in the file manager, and there, no matter the size, it is resized to the same height as all other notebooks. 

Just leave it.",1609440531

kqqa3p,1,I tried out procreate and made 25 fun notebook covers for you all (link in comments),,,hippiesinthewind,"Hi so I figured it out

Basically I should have save them as a PDF instead of a jpeg as I guess jpeg does save the size properly

What appears to work is turn the saved jpeg file into a PDF. I did this two different ways

1. I pressed and held on the image of notebook in my file folder leading to an array of options popping up. The last option being create PDF.

Then I uploaded pdf copy to good notes, 

While this worked I did find I had white lines on the side of the notebook but the notebook was the same size as paper

Option 2 I did was I imported the jpeg image into procreate then re-saved as a PDF, this way I did not get the white lines when importing to goodnotes

I saw some people also recommended using pages to convert to PDF.


But if you still have the white lines come up on notebook and do not want, let me know which notebook covers you wanted to use and I can do it in procreate for you",1610256296

So the MCU is a combination of 616, 1610, and its own continuity. 

Obviously Normans power should come the Oz serum but instead of just giving him strength we should adapt the 1610 version and its should give him the ability to transform into the greengoblin. Now, he shouldn't turn into a big a monster like 1610 becasue we want 616 so this Oz formula should have some sort of basis on Skrull dna. Since the formula is still a very experimental drug something goes wrong and it only gives him the ability to turn from human to skrull. 

All this ^^^ is just to justify his green goblin face because having a slicone mask is just flat out stupid. The skrull basically look like green goblin and they look great in the MCU.

As for the suit I guess they'll just have to give it the MCU flair and try to make him look good and be as a faithfull to the comics.",1622870549

kxmtzy,1,Hey guys! I’m new to GoodNotes. Suggest me to improve!!!,,,IcyEbonyRo5e,I wouldn’t use very many colors unless it helps with memorization or studying. With so many colors it can be distracting for the mind and make studying difficult. I would suggest using black color for your pen color through the body of your notes and then spice up important points with highlighters. Another suggestion might be using the different pen type for different things like ball-point for body text and brush pen for headers.,1610720132

l132c1,1,New thoughts on pen thickness settings.,,I'm now of the opinion the size of the paper dictates the sizes of the pen thickness. Since most pdf journals being sold on Etsy use A4 templates writing with thick pen sizes will cause you to waste too much space to write simple sentences. I discovered the right size to use when using the zoom box is 0.45mm. However at regular style writing without the zoom box the right size to use from my point of view is still 1.2mm. The in between level is still 0.7mm. The only problem is when using the 0.45mm size is this causes writing to become too small to be legible. The only workaround is to either zoom onto the small text area or enlarge the text manually.,taipeifoodygirl,I personally always use 3 mm. Mainly because I don’t mind zooming in .,1611137578

Can’t speak for the iPad Pro since I’ve only got the Air but in terms of writing on PDFs that teachers give you, being able to tag and mark up various types of questions by topic it’s brilliant. I prefer it to noteability purely because of how you can organise it as I didn’t like the structure of noteability. 

In terms of entire textbooks I’ve never had the need to import a textbook and I’m on my final semester. Any textbook I’ve needed to reference I’ve just took pictures of the pages in Uni or at home. For questions and solutions I use screenshooting and annotating a lot - especially with exam style questions or professional body definitions and explanations etc where the original source matters and I don’t want to take away from the original format.

He was on morphine, there's the shock of being told he had 6-8 weeks to live, and I had him write down the events that happened, and then sent them to our previous attorney. There are text messages and phone logs that make it pretty easy to implicate perjury.  For example, she said that my dad was saying I was going to kill her. Reality was I was going to help him move his things out, and she was informed this. We have time-stamped craigslist listings for such.

You basically are losing alarms, reminders, easy reprioritization, connection to contacts, and a lot of other advantages you get just using your calendar, phone, and task apps on your phone that come with it. 

Handwriting a journal makes good sense, because writing by hand helps with catharsis and memory. Handwriting notes makes good sense, because again memory is aided by handwriting. Also, using a pencil to take notes in a meeting doesn’t seem like you are mentally checked out to the other person the way that typing does.

But handwriting a planner? Now you are just drawing your schedule, tasks, and contact info for no reason than aesthetics. It’s inefficient and ineffective.",1611177675

Başarısızlıklarının sebebi olarak şişman olmalarını gösterirsem tam da senin yaptığın şey olur. Oysaki başarısızlıklarının sebebi zeka geriliği olması. Şimdi konumuza dönelim 10 erkek düşün, bunların hepsi eşlerini veya bir aile üyesini kültürüne uymadığı için öldürmüş kişiler olsun. Bunların kötü olan özelliği erkek olmaları mı yoksa bok gibi kültürlerde yetişmiş ve bunu benimsemiş olmaları mı? Türkiyede feminist olduğunu iddia edenlerin de yarısı erkek düşmanı.

also, your math is pretty off. Hannah is 3 when they're captured? 10 where we are now? that's 7 years... June's journey is 2 years + 2 years = 4 years , plus 8 months?

l4flmb,1,ISO template in light mode,Templates,,Quentinnock,"What kills the map for me is just low grav, in a game where passive campy play styles are already super good you make a map that slows you down when jumping, especially when the only thing you can do besides accepting being shot is jumping...

Deadbeard could be looking at his phone doing something else and he's still gonna hit all his shots. Low grav makes everything so freaking slow it kills interactions with certain classes and it just ends up being a drag...

Not to mention the map is a victim of the ""wallnut hills syndrome"" if the defence is good there's no hope for the offence to ever make it past 1st point, hell they can't even make it past spawn which is even worse then wallnut hills...

Areas with normal gravity are actually fine though. It's like the only good things about the map. There are still issues there obviously like how you have to cross Football fields devoid of any forms of cover before making it to point 2. But at least the experience is tolerable...

The end game is ok too, if you're on offense I mean. I'm a bit biased here since I can count with my hands the amount of times I went through it on defense, which goes to show how stupid easy this map is to defend.",1622870701

It's just that many of them have numberous and sometimes ridiculous bylaws that they can easily enforce since you agreed to them already upfront when you bought the property. 

If the city thinks your property is a trash heap and eyesore, it can take months for them to do anything; if at all. The fines are usually piddly. A HOA can start fining you on day 1 and if you don't pay put a lean on the house and in extreme cases force a sale.",1622870701

As far as your second point, they make more money by making higher profit margins per GPU sold. ROS is just as if not more important than units sold. Why do you think a 3080ti and 3070ti were made? Because Nvidia felt generous? They saw the market, saw a way to capitalize with little effort and are doing exactly that. If they could relaunch the 30 series all over again they would come out with much higher prices and I will bet we will see the next generation reflect that. 

If Nvidia or AMD or all these retailers really cared about scalping they would actually be putting effort and resources into actually stopping it. It is 2021 and you're trying to tell me retailers are incapable of an actual queue system that allows one GPU per person? If they really cared you hear about lobbying for actual laws to prevent scalping, you would see retailers actually preventing people from buying multiple units to simply flip the second they get home. Instead we have bullshit lotto systems, EVGA queue systems that have still not shipped cards that were reserved on release, and retailers have stock drops that do almost nothing to prevent repeat buyers or bots from snagging up all the inventory. 

They have done the absolute bare minimum when it comes to trying to combat bots and scalpers. They do not give a fuck about stopping it. All they are doing is taking notes and figuring what their new price points can be moving forward.",1622870705

Schools, Cinemas and tourist sites reopened in the summer, which had been in lockdown for almost half a year and kept opening until now.
Man, why I believe the gov number since last summer? Don't get me wrong, I don't like them, they did a shitty job in the beginning. They pour stupid ideology into my head, i fucking hate it. 
It's simply because every thing, every body i know, they kind forget the covid stuff. That is normal. It's the fruit owing to my people, who strictly obeyed the quarantine and social distance rule.

Corporations throw on rainbows for the sole purpose of appealing to people that like rainbows. They are either trying to appeal to customers by loudly showing that they are pro LGBT, or more often, are loudly signaling to potential employees that they are LGBT friendly place to work. Corporations are not trying to secretly prove their LGBT purity to themselves, by sacrificing everything to bring LGBT liberation around the world. They're just trying to appeal to LGBT folks. there's a reason why Starbucks covers itself in rainbows, but Hobby Lobby does not. One of those corporations is trying to attract LGBT folks, and one of those corporations is trying to attract religious people. They are loudly signaling what they both prefer. It's good when they prefer LGBT people.

LGBT folks in some places in this world only wish that corporations were spending a month openly pandering to them, and trying to convince them that they're friendly places to work or shop at. Complaining about corporations covering themselves in rainbow has got to be the most privileged first world whining the face of this planet.",1622870729

I am in the camp of not all exotics need catalysts. Catalysts were a way to make Exotic weapons feel more like something that grows with you, they were introduced the same time as masterworking... or atleast very close together, it's hard to remember exactly, however, some exotics are just great, face value. it's why some catalysts so powerful, and others just add some throwaway stats.  


In the case of La Monarque and Wish-ender, I'd honestly want to see them buffed in some fashion first, and then have catalysts made after the buffs were analyzed. La Monarque could maybe get away with just having a catalyst that expands on it's effect, but Wish-ender has always needed some buff or rework to let it be more useful at a base level.  giving it a catalyst would be putting the cart before the horse.",1622870729

Meaning you can have multiple pages of notes with one heading and summary,,,Generic_Nameee,"Also for what it’s worth I know people who are triggered by blood, one to the point they faint on sight of they see it, and not a single one of them are bothered by red shirts, including the fainter. It’s a ridiculous comparison. 

When dealing with trauma and triggers, both parties need to come to an agreement. The person with the trigger is under no obligation to put aside their trigger and “deal with it” any more than anyone else is. 

However a trigger is more than discomfort, and a trigger is not being offended by something. Like I’m legit not offended by any of my triggers nor do I find them offensive.  The nature of triggers and trauma makes them extremely difficult to separate out. Life would be so much simpler if that were the case. 

For example I have some huge triggers, and I expect people respect those when I’m around. If people are upset because they think my triggers have to do with them personally? Not my problem. My responsibility is to voice my needs and work with the people around me so we can all be comfortable. 

OP and the other person need to have a discussion on it and come to an agreement. OP shouldn’t have to suck it up, that’s how shit builds up and starts coming out in strange ways. Learning to discuss and navigate triggers in a productive manner is sadly a very essential part of life when you have trauma :/",1622870735

l8o4zb,1,Will Adonit Jot Pro work for goodnotes 5 on an iPad mini 3?,Question - iPad,"I’m looking into digital note taking and goodnotes looks great, but the problem is I only have an iPad mini 3. Apple Pencil isn’t compatible with it... I’ve looked into Adonit Jot Pro, but I don’t know if it will work. On the website it says it works on “all touchscreen devices” but I don’t know if an iPad mini 3 will be able to distinguish between the stylus and my hand. Help??",durgante,"When you say 

&gt;""... but I don’t know if an iPad mini 3 will be able to distinguish between the stylus and my hand.""

If you're asking about palm rejection within goodnotes, I would bet it won't. Goodnotes supports only Apple Pencil as a stylus. So I believe it is going to treat any other stylus as passive, and probably palm rejection will be subpar or non-existent.",1612062329

&gt;* Total ban non-resident ownership of Canadian real estate 

Not going to happen since this mo ey brings in billions of dollars from offshore boosting economies, plus not all money is bad lots of it goes into huge rental developments 

&gt;* 50% tax for second residences * 50% tax for vacant residences (more than half the year) 

The people who have second residences are not a significant problem.

&gt;* Use the CMHC for their historical mandate (to build millions of affordable houses for families to own) 

This is what they're doing through making mortgages more affordable by Insuring them so that banks will offer lower rates. This has the unintended consequences of raising demand way past supply 

&gt;* Abolish (or make much less restrictive) zoning laws: there shouldn't be single-family homes anywhere near the CN Tower (as is the case currently) 

Bingo this is where you hit the problem perfectly. In places like Edmonton of you have a 50 ft lot they automatically let you split the lot in half to build two homes and they allow garden suites in many neighbourhoods, they also got rid of all parking requirements. They're probably going to go further in a few years and automatically allow a 4plex into a single family home site 


&gt;* Regulate the real estate agent industry into the ground. They are by-and-large a vampiric and rent-seeking class of professionals that provides little-to-no actual value to buyers and sellers. 

They had a value 30 years ago before the internet and they were compensated for the amount of work it took today the post some shit pictures on Mls and expect 25k payday and the other guy chaperones some people around a few houses and expects the other 25k


&gt;Above all, encourage and promote and enable home **ownership** for families and individuals. Creating a nation of renters is the last thing we want to do - ownership provides people with a reason to care about their environment and their country.

Renting will always have an important place and we can't screw the affordable rental market for people",1622870797

Of course there lgbtq people with different circumstances and a different view but I only really get attached to someone if they are familiar with the problems I face.

lcn1jx,42,Structure for note taking (science subjects),,"Want to share my structure for note taking. The font for the ""chapters"" is called ""Noteworthy"". I am also using more colors for my pen but i dont have a structure for them.

I recommend this kind of ""chapter style"" if you want to have a neat overview of your topics. For me it works in chemistry or mathematics. Can imagine its useable in any  science subject. 

I recommend to use this style for subjects which deal with equations or molecule structures. For subjects with texts only, its not helpful. 

U can mix this style with the Cornell-Methode which i will do when i start studying in an university. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some sort of feedback?

However, reality caught up with them and their demons, pasts, problems exploded in their faces. They are two imperfect people, damaged by life and haunted by demons. They hung on to each other because they desperately needed connection, were similar and needed to hold on to the peaceful feeling they had when they met. But the truth was that until they had learned to know themselves, to accept themselves, to work out their demons, and to make their own decisions about what they wanted, their relationship was doomed to fail. This is what makes it so tragic. If they had met at the right time, they might have worked out. Each knew it and that's what made their moment even more heartbreaking. They knew they were damaged and used the other to fill a void. But the strength and depth of their love caught them off guard and shook them even more. 

I think this nuance and imperfection made it difficult for many people to buy into this romance. Because, more than a tragic love story, it is a tragic and damaged life story that is described.",1622870810

Yes, I agree.

&gt;Also, she never raised problems with his love of alcohol/blood (or never raised these points at all -- these are an assumption by you). Her only contention with Robert we know of was that he wouldn't keep to one bed. Which she seemingly (if you believe R+L=J) forgot about that contention with Rhaeger.

We don't know enough about lyanna or her story with rhaegar to say things for sure. I extended her displeasure to the other two things bc they might come up later on. One could also say that she was simply making up excuses bc she just didn't like him and/or didn't want to get married at all. We can only especulate for now.

&gt;And certainly Lyanna might change or grow up or out of her contention or learn to live with it 

Yes, but would she learn to love him? There could be a chance, but we can't know for sure. With Robert, her being only conformed with their marriage could be enough to break his heart. He loved her, wanted to have an ideal life with her and he always wants to have what he whises for.

I just don't think that, had he ended up with her, their relationship would be something whorty of all his dreams.",1622870815

lfwnle,1,do you think goodnotes will ever actually implement streamline?,,,NoxDineen,"It’s possible. But when I did customer support for a software company “thanks for the suggestion, I’ll add it to our feature request list” was standard reply and didn’t mean it was even being considered.

lfwnle,1,do you think goodnotes will ever actually implement streamline?,,,XF939495xj6,"That is the standard language both this company and the company that produce Notability are known for. They regularly respond with “We will add it to the list!” Explanation: software development usually involves working in teams from a backlog, and in order to control the flow of work, the teams will put things on the backlog, prioritize those requests, and then only work on the most valuable things at the top of the list. They do this regularly every week, couple of weeks, or month. 

That’s how they handle their internal business requests for features. They say “added to the list”, do some math, and then prioritize it. Usually that means it is put nowhere in range of any near-term work, and you are blown off.

This is a terrible way to interact with a customer because it is non-transparent, which violates the values of most software development, and it is misleading and deceitful. 

Instead, they should publish their plans for all new features for the coming year, let you know what those priorities are, who they are for, and why they are working on them. If you make a request, they should honestly answer “We have that on our list, but not this year and maybe not next” so you can grieve and go away.

People will be refreshing the App Store every day wondering if their latest reddit post or tweet has their favorite feature in it. 

But don’t feel too bad. I have been bitching about the highlighter and eraser in GoodNotes for a LONG time, and I have never even gotten a reply. AFAIK, there is zero plan to update either, even though these are vastly inferior to the same two tools in Notability.",1613000532

The person talking says ""short sellers borrowing stock they didn't have"". This is what regular ass short selling is. You borrow shares and sell them. 

If you borrow the shares and owned some long, it's called short against the box. 

The anchor says ""yeah naked short selling""
Naked short selling is selling stock you neither have nor borrow. It is different from what the other person said. 

One of the two misspoke or spoke poorly. 

But reddit sees it a evidence that the real gme squeeze will happen any day now for a price of $10k/ share. And there's a wide ranging conspiracy between media.and all institutions to suppress the price to save a couple hedge funds.

Thank you for your help",biddy1207,"As an Asian from Taiwan I can explain my point of view. 
1.
Some people say that The art style fortnite is too cartoonish. Most asian like more realistic games like pubg. But pubg is dead, The most popular game now in Asia is apex. legends

2. As for Taiwanese they don’t like to grind for a game and they don’t like shooter games.  They prefer pay to win games like some mobile games. Shooter games are already hard not to speak of fortnite. 

3. Ping is the pain in the ass.",1622870851

Thank you for your help",ILikeMistborn,"It's a lot rarer than just claiming that trans women are delusional rapists and is mostly used by terfs and terf-adjacent assholes that want to pretend that they care about the well beings of the people they hate. 

And to answer your other question: I can't really say if it's good or bad, but I will say that I understand your anxiety regardless. That being said however, it is worth noting that subs like this can make terf rhetoric seem far more prevalent and prominent than it actually is. In reality I feel like most people*,* ***depending on where you are***, aren't this vile and hateful and the ones that are are often fairly obvious about it so they're relatively easy to avoid. I can't speak for your personal experiences or situation but I feel like most likely you won't find yourself with someone this hateful, maybe someone who's ignorant or doesn't fully understand everything but probably not someone who fantasizes about murdering their own child with a brick for being trans.

So, I am relying on Google Drive for backup purposes. Now My notebooks are being backed up as individual PDFs, and another Auto Backup is being saved as a ZIP file in google drive when I choose to back up. Now from goodnotes's forum, I found out that the ZIP file is for one-tap restoring, if I change the device or uninstall the app I can just IMPORT that ZIP file, and everything will be downloaded and sorted as before. My question is then why are the individual PDFs? it's just taking double space in my Google Drive by saving the same file twice.",shinrak2507,"that is something that was on my mind as well.

it is super weird tbh.

especially, you can just open the zip file and import the PDFs separately.

lneepm,1,Scanneren documents,,,AutoModerator,"Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 2.9% plus $0.30), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you are violating PP ToS.

Or rather, why is ABA taking the brunt of whatever the problem is when it seems more fundamental than that? I'm just curious and asking to immerse myself in the history of conflicting perspectives on the topic.

And thank you for assuming the best of me; I really do care about my son. And I'm actually not necessarily opposed to the fate of providing for him directly for as long as I'm around. Not to be morbid, but as a parent, I'm already so far removed from the idea of him going out on his own at 18 or whenever into adulthood. I'd be thrilled by that, but I'm more thinking, how do I at least get him to a place where he can take care of himself after I'm gone and he's 47 (random age) and still not independent?

I know I'm probably over-thinking it and baby steps and all that, but those are some of the thoughts that keep me up at night.

I’m talking about people who are actually from around here don’t consider Garfield park the NW side. 

It also doesn’t make sense to say that everything west of western is considered west. Because if we really wanted to be technical, since Chicago is on a grid, anything west of State streets is west and anything north of Madison is north.

50% correct, the civil rights act no longer protects political affiliation for employment however most states do, California being the biggest among them.

However no, if people genuinely wanted to start discriminating in that way you would very quickly see all states pass similar measures because business owners are more often conservative.

&gt;Only the states NY and CA have laws preventing discrimination of someone because of their political beliefs in hiring practices.

More than that, but they certainly realize what you fail to. If you want to force the issue of only hiring people you agree with politically, the left will lose overwhelmingly.

Just note that if you delete a page and then try to copy the same page from a new copy to add it in, those hyperlinks will not work (I learned this from experience unfortunately).",1613766610

You'll notice that in the base game they constantly change speeds and turn super slow like they're drifting, and sometimes they take different paths than the squad. 

Kenshi makes it extremely simple to mod things yourself because you can launch the game with an editor that lets you change game values and save them as a mod. If you know where to look it takes like 5 minutes to make a mod.",1622870951

There was never any evidence that Russia helped get Trump elected.

That was merely a Democrat conspiracy theory repeated again, again and again without any meaningful evidence.

&gt; The influence was easy, targeted advertising and taking advantage of the human failings of American voters.

10,000 ads of Facebook got Trump elected...? Nevermind the majority of those ads had nothing to do with politics.

&gt; They worked directly and indirectly with the Trump family and team and they hacked the DNC.

There as no evidence for this, either. Another Democrat conspiracy theory.

&gt; This would have come out in Trump's trial if the Republican held senate hadn't blocked his Impeachment trial.

No ~ you're hypothesizing that something like this would have come out had the Republicans not struck down the impeachment trial.

It was struck down because there was no real evidence ever presented for the accusations leveled against Trump.

Not to mention that the House impeachment was ham-fistedly pushed through by the Democrats. They deliberately prevented the House Republicans from speaking or bringing forth their own witnesses or testimonies.

&gt; If you don't believe this you need a Q sized conspiracy to replace it. And if you're that far gone there's no bringing you back with facts.

I don't consider any of these endlessly repeated Democrat talking points to be ""facts"". They're conspiracy theories, and were never anything more.",1622870962

As the brake pads wear out they will get thinner, so you want to add shims between the pads and the caliper pistons to keep the correct spacing between the rotor and the pad. Keeping that spacing consistent will mean the brakes always start to engage at the same point in the throw of the brake pedal. Beyond that there's isn't really anything special. There should be a groove in the center of the brake pad, you can use that as your guide for when to replace the pads with new pads, but really there isn't a lot of reason you couldn't run the pads until they only have a few millimeters left. Whenever you replace the brake pads make sure you take the shims out and if you don't have a floating disk to recenter your brake rotor to make sure both pads contact the rotor at the same time. If the pads don't contact at the same time you could put stress on the rotor.",1622870979

While I agree, it's really rude to tell someone they should just reject their traditions and lose their family support over a principal, when there may be several benefits to going with it and you don't really understand the significance of any of it. Tradition is very important, although it's important to update it. But that is a process, one couple refusing is not enough to change it and keeping ties to their culture and family may feel more important to them, the cons are more than the pros. You can't really understand all the nuances of someone's situation and you sound arrogant as hell. 

Even if you're right, I still think the people in this thread judging her for not creating drama with MIL when she was exhausted and lives with them aren't being fair.

Self care is setting boundaries, eating well, going to the gym, addressing stressful situations, having hard conversations, paying my bills on time, getting enough sleep, learning positive coping mechanisms, making my health a priority, and doing all the hard things I don't want to but will make me feel better in the future. These things can not be a reward, they are necessary for creating a healthy life.

Self soothing is the binging tv, eating favourite snacks, having a nap, luxuriating in the shower, going for a nice meal, feeling better in the short term things, making myself my favourite cookies, reading in bed all cozied up. They have their place, they make us feel better in the moment (which can be important) but do little to address long term issues in our lives. Self-soothing activities can be rewards! I use massages as a reward for hitting goals in the gym.

I am all for treating myself and taking time to enjoy things. I make a point of doing things I enjoy every day, of finding pleasure in small things. I also set rewards for when I reach goals. I think we should all take time to enjoy the little things in our lives be it a hot shower, a walk in a pretty park, our favourite tv show, or a good snack. But we should also be doing the hard things to make our lives healthier so we can be more resilient and able to take charge of our lives.",1622871028

Bitmap means a bunch of discrete pixels, like a photograph. That's what you have here, and you can tell because when you zoom in it looks blocky and pixelated.

Vector means that information about curves and shapes is stored (rather than pixels) so that you can zoom in as far as you like and it will still be crisp. One way to get vector-based graphics in a PDF is by exporting from an app like GoodNotes or Notability. 

For example, I have imported into GoodNotes a PDF generated by someone else using Notability, and GoodNotes is able to recognize the handwriting and let me search it. However, when I import a PDF that someone made by scanning a sheet of paper, because the resulting PDF is using bitmap (image) based graphics, GoodNotes doesn't recognize the handwriting.",1615508795

There's one called Vision and I've used it to build apps to read text.  It actually works really well and it can be trained on how to read certain things.

There should be apps out there to do that.

If they don't work well, you can use AI to clean things up and then retry.

m6cp5r,1,Create Paper Templates for GoodNotes in ZoomNotes,,"Hi, everyone!

As many of you probably also do, I tend to experiment with a ton of different apps and templates. I always feel like things could be a bit better. 

One of the apps I’ve experimented with a great deal is ZoomNotes. While I love all that it has to offer, it always feels a bit too junky for me. 

One feature I *love* is it’s ability to generate template based on very specific parameters. You can adjust size, color, grid type and size, add columns, and a ton of other things. Just tap the + symbol, create a new document, and tap “Custom.”

It’s super useful! I feel like I haven’t really heard people talk about it, so I thought I would bring it up. If you are always wanted to fiddle around with your templates, it’s a really great tool.",BookWormAttorney,Thanks for Sharing.,1615923725

I was just wondering, if i am alone with this wish.

I used to be a onenote user and really appreciated the amount of settings i can tweak to make the program look/work/feel exactly like i want it to. I got myself an 12.9 inch ipad pro and i am kinda disappointed by the lack of features of goodnotes.
Don't get me wrong, goodnotes works great and the feeling of writing with it is great imo, but still.

However, you are totally not alone in the fact that GoodNotes feels limiting, and I would recommend checking out Zoomnotes for what you’re looking for. It’s insanely powerful for a note taking app, if a bit ugly in UI. I’m not sure how many features that you’re looking for it has but it’s just absolutely insane, like users talk about how you can build a completely hyperlinked planner in-app). It’s around the same price as GoodNotes, but I would recommend looking at YouTube reviews before you jump in since it also has a steep learning curve apparently 😊",1617152044

mhd00x,1,viewing only the pages with notes on them?,,"Hi all!

I made the switch from Notability to GoodNotes about 6 months ago, and for the most part vastly prefer how it organizes notebooks. But a lot of my work involves importing and then marking up long PDFs, and Notability has a feature where you can view thumbnails of only the PDF pages that you've written notes on.  Super handy if you've got to type up your notes and there are only, say, 10 pages out of 100 you have thoughts on. Is there any way to accomplish a similar feat with GoodNotes? To see what pages of a PDF you've written on?

So after my meeting I can spend 5-10 mins proofreading the converted text so that in the future when I actually need to search I will get what I’m looking for.",mgm9828,Yeah I put a little box in every corner with a box of bullet points with the main elements with the text feature. That way you can search it but it's still tedious,1617616115
mkewii,1,Fixing handwriting recognition for future use,,"I have a question about the handwriting search.

  
lets say I make some notes in my terrible handwriting. I don’t really want to convert them to text immediately since I have drawing etc in there too. but Lets say 2 weeks in I need to search for something and it can’t find it because the handwritten Word wasn’t recognized properly due to my handwriting. This is clearly a problem.

My issue is usually I use this for work and have tonnes of meetings. Sometimes I know I had a discussion about something specific with someone and don’t know when, and need to recall the details, and may remember some obscure detail or word, so need all the notes transcribed. I may just add the full corrected translated text in small font and see how that works.",1617624545
mkh1qd,1,Easy way to include outline actually ON for example second page of a document?,Question - iPad,"So outline works. That’s great as long as you stay on your iPad. Opening your outlined pdf (editable) export gives a neat overview of the chapters you’ve set, also when reading in Apple Books. 
BUT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT ADDING YOUR OUTLINE EFFECTIVELY ON A PAGE. Did none of the devs really think of that or am I just missing something? 
Right now, I have to take a screenshot of the index in iBooks, return to my Goodnotes document, add the screenshot to page 2 or 3 to create an in-document table of contents... 

Seems crazy; is this the only way to do this?",JB_horn_ME,"Yeah, that's pretty rough. Also, if trying to open the editable PDF on a Windows laptop, the pages tend to take a while to load due to being editable and (in Chrome PDF viewer) the bookmarks tend to be off by a page.

I've resorted to outlining my document as I write it out and then making a table of contents manually on the first page based on the outline. This allows me to export flattened but still know which page covers which concepts, etc.

Definitely takes a good three or four minutes for longer lecture notes (which can add up over time), but it's what works best with my academic workflow.",1617647089
mkjm1f,1,Using goodnotes as a regular BoJo,Question - iPad,"I use goodnotes for my journal like many here. But I like to use it like a  BoJo on pen and paper with the goodness of digital notetaking.  For some reason using digital journal with click shortcuts gives an app like feel which takes away the feel of good old pen and paper.

Additionally, if anyone uses the app the way I do. Would be glad to exchange templates for journal.",proflupinx,I sent you a DM :),1617822389

Is there any reason to get it over what I’ve been using which is a combination of OneNote and PDF Expert.

So what do you guys think, are there any major differences between the apps?",Benster981,"I own both good notes and notability and like notability better. It is definitely worth it to buy the app, I have hardly used good notes but I’m okay with that since I’ve got so much value from notability and would have bought it ten times over. 

I’d say look more into notability and go for whichever takes your fancy, you won’t regret it :)",1617655615

OneNote is for me ridiculously unstable and unreliable. It is impossible to get information out of it in any usable form - printing or sharing. I never understand why people love it so much and I’ve tried so many times as a fully paid up O365 user to like it. Apple notes is far better these days. 

I’m a self employed consultant and I’m also studying one day a week - I use GoodNotes for my course notes and it’s been great. Everything else is in Apple

Notability is simpler and I prefer the inking tools; however I’m using a Cornell template for my notes and GoodNotes is better from a templates perspective. It also has a good outlining feature for larger notebooks. Notability has good syncing with audio which has been invaluable for stakeholder interviews and research, so I use both - they’re not expensive to me. 

If I’m honest, they’re both very capable and the principle difference comes down to templates and organisation (GoodNotes) vs audio and inking (notability).",1617732093

For example, I find that I stall out on rimworld research (not vanilla, but more mods will add a lot more research), but I can solve this by bumping the research multiplier to say 200% so I can complete research in a reasonable amount of time. I take ideas for scenarios from youtubers or friends, after a while of playing and messing with mods you can begin to come up with some interesting playthoughs",1622871262

Thank you!",eulersheep,"The thing with quantum is we don't even have a proper theoretical framework in place for writing quantum algorithms, like what von Neumann gave us for classical computation. We know a few algorithms, like Shor's, but they've essentially all been guessed. People like the analogy that quantum computation is in a similar state now as classical computation was in the early to mid 20th century, but it's not even that far advanced yet.... a more appropriate analogy would be an abacus...

The hope is that by at least building the hardware, we will get more insight which should also help the theory to progress. But it is a monumentally difficult task. There may also be some physical limitations that ultimately prevent us from building quantum computers with thousands of qubits in coherence (required for quantum error correction to execute Shor's), i.e. a real quantum computer might need to be planet sized (or something like that).

That's not to say we won't overcome these problems in the future, but I'm just trying to emphasize how much work there is still to do in this field and how difficult the problems are...",1622871333

I am using an iPad Pro 11"", Apple Pencil 2. Changed to a fresh tip just to confirm it's not the pencil, tried notability and notes just to confirm its not the screen protector/ipad screen itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Issue 1: if I write something or highlight something, and immediately switch to the eraser, it will not be able to detect the last thing I wrote. like how I could not delete the highlight until I tapped on the screen (you see me tapping the screen and the eraser turns up on screen at 0:13) then it would ""recognise"" the highlight

Issue 2: the glitching!! gets on my nerves and honestly was the reason why I (had to) switch to notability. i use goodnotes to project my notes in my classroom and it was causing glitches every few lines I wrote.

I just think it's a unfair to expect all promises to be fulfilled. like sure, criticize away, but if you make statements like these, u essentially ignore their actual legit reasons why they decided to postpone content. i can still say ur criticism is shit and not constructive. 

in the game dev industry, esp triple A, its known that people are worked into the bone. Mojang made a transparent decision to split the features into two updates for the sake of worker mental health and i personally commend them for that. when you are the biggest game, you set examples. while triple A will likely continue to overwork their game devs, Mojang i know treats their staff with care and compassion.",1622871343

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",kaesekarl,"I started digital note-taking in my last year of school. I used a Lenovo Yoga with onenote to write stuff down. I mostly write mathematical stuff so having a pen for these is a no-brainer for me. I gave many people advice on digital note-taking, which device is the best one for them etc, and i boiled it down to a few questions you should ask yourself :

1. Do you ACTUALLY need digital notes? What is the real benefit of making them because it's kind of hyped now and many people just ""do some scetches"" or just ""write that one equation down"", for those it is probably not the best thing to do. Don't forget: Digital note-taking is expensive. Every device which is capable of taking digital notes with a pen is relatively expensive, ipads (especially the pro-line), laptops which can be flipped(like the one i used) or laptop/tablet hybrids (like the surface pro).

2. If you decide it's worth your money, pick a device that fits your needs. If you pretty much only use a pen (and have a ""real computer at hand) get an iPad, the pen is straight up the best in the game. If you also need some power on the go, get something like the yoga, it's a solid laptop with up to 8 cores, 32GB of ram, blablabla, depends on your needs and also if you use this as your only machine or as a secondary device.

3. Maybe a normal laptop is just right for you? If you study something like languages, economics or law, you will be mostly writing texts. So having a good keyboard is a necessity. In that case, a normal laptop would be pretty much all you need. Be honest with yourself and don't just buy something because ""well XY is using this for his studies so it must work for me"".

4. Do you have the skills to actually benefit from the digital world? I know, this sounds harsh because ""of course i have those, i mean this is the modern world and i live inside of it"". But believe it or not, many of my colleagues just don't have the skill set to efficiently take digital notes. Not just copy/paste, but you have to adjust your work flow, keep your data in a useful structure, make backups (seriously, if anyone reads this and doesn't have a backup of his/her notes, make one right now) and many other things like ""how does my colleague get this thing"", what if i want to collab with people etc etc etc... 


Paper with a pen let's you do everything you can imagine, but every application, every device you use is designed by people who are thinking different than you. I got really frustrated while trying to find THE PERFECT App for taking notes until i figured out, not a single app can do everything i want it to.
I still use a good ol' paper-notebook for brainstorming, just because it gives me the opportunity to do exactly what i want, no ""super smooth curves"" or ""super clean images"". Some things are just messy in and of itself, and nothing is better at capturing your thoughts that a piece of paper and a pen.


Maybe this sounds like a rant, i am really not, but maybe this should be a step into seeing the downsides of digital note-taking and not just the beautiful future we want it to be...

If you want some further advice, just pm me, budget, usage are pretty important factors (as i already mentioned) so with more information about your future use case etc maybe i can be a little more helpful",1620671775

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",fnnll08,"I finished my first degree by mostly writing on paper. At least during the lectures. I usually wrote a study guide on my laptop but it wasn't perfect. I always wished for a way to make it pretty and efficient by highlighting definitions in boxes or just highlight with a digital highlighter. To be honest I think I would have been happy with paper notes but I always wished for an iPad it was just too expensive I thought.
In my last year I used a surface thinking I would have a laptop that's easy to carry around for writing stuff with a keyboard but I also wanted to take digital handwritten notes. My biggest problem with taking digital hand written notes on the surface was that I was using one note and it just didn't work for me. I've searched ages for an app that would let you annotated PDFs and also let's you put pages ""in between"" because my studying often required answering questions in the scripts. All the apps I found were prescription based and thats's just unnecessary expensive imo. I just hated that I had three binders for math because I wanted to have the questions of the lecture of my homework and of studying separately. With goodnotes you can have these different binders all in one place.

I also want to highlight the functions of digital notes during covid-19. My university requires us to upload our homework or work in teams online. And it's just so much easier to share your screen or send an email with you homework without scanning it first.

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",cappucinnoclouds,"I agree with everyone who is saying that it takes time to get used to! I always swore that I would never make the switch. I lugged around my pens, mildliners, and Moleskines in college because I was determined not to go digital. Then I started thinking about grad school and realized that things like books and articles could be exported into Goodnotes and annotated, and I caved. I would never EVER switch back. I love digital notes SO much. 

edit: (I have the iPad Pro)

edit #2 lol I truly never read other poster’s comments before posting my own. I skim them. This is in response to mathematical Lenovo user. 

Firstly, I would be wary of any Microsoft user who is warning you off buying a Mac product. In my experience, it’s 80/20 that they have a strong anti-Mac bias. (I used exclusively Microsoft products pre-2016)

Secondly, I have a Macbook Pro 2016 and an iPad Pro May 2020 model. These are my two primary devices. My use for them will be different from our mathematical friend over at Lenovo. Still, I’ll say this from my own experience—I am shocked just often I reach for my iPad after years of using my Macbook for everything. Now, this will not be your case. The iPad Pro can replace some functions of the Macbook Pro, but even then, it can’t substitute itself for one. However, with a keyboard and a mouse, you’re a hell of a lot more equipped to run the iPad as a “Mobile Oval,” to lovingly quote from “Veep.” It’s your presidential replacement on the go, and from what I understand, even the iPad Air can handle that. (Isn’t the Gen 2 Apple Pencil now compatible with the Air?) 

Secondly.Two, if you’ll take a recommendation from me, ditch the stupid keyboard case and cut straight for the Logitech super slim keyboard. It’s waterproof and weighs very little. I love mine. Get a cheap case from Amazon or something. The keyboard cases are ridiculously overpriced. The Logitech keyboard is something like $70 and holds a charge forever. 

Thirdly, I don’t know what your learning style is, what your major might be, or what else you may want to consider, but digital note-taking is an excellent idea for people with significant reading loads. I was an English education major, and I’ll be attending a master’s program for journalism this fall. I foresaw a hefty reading load. That means I had to lug around several literary anthologies, print out hundreds of short stories etc., etc. It would’ve saved me money to buy the iPad in the first place. 

Fourthly, I do want to point out that you shouldn’t be buying the iPad because of what you see from this trend in digital note-taking. It’s very pretty, and that is definitely why I love it, but it is a considerable expense. I am impulsive by nature. If you are wise, you may want to have someone sit down with you and work out the figures. 

I would say I printed well over 8k pages while in undergrad. That’s for sure lowballing. I know for one class alone, I had to have printed at least a thousand. And that was one single semester. Weigh printer costs against what you would save. I don’t know. Maybe you will break even, and perhaps it’ll be significantly more expensive to buy the iPad. I’m not a math person. 

Fifth, and finally, I think it’s essential that you have something to look forward to going into college. I think it’s worth noting that I use my iPad every single day and have used it almost every day since I purchased it. Now, granted, I did buy it during quarantine, so that’s not a perfect example. However, I do use Goodnotes every day, and I am currently not working and am not attending school until the fall. 

Some highlights:

* I love digital planning now. I was never a consistent planner before, but now I try to plan out my week (or at least jot some things down). I bought my planner from Three65Planners on Etsy, and I highly recommend it. It’s loaded with hyperlinks and templates. 
* Organization. I have severe ADHD, and my organization has always been “throw things anywhere.” Goodnotes’ search feature is fantastic, and I have tons of folders. 
* Color options. I have 150 pen presets, and 48 highlighter presets on Goodnotes. Think about lugging around 150 pens and 48 highlighters, a huge planner, and 70 journals. That would suck. 
* Stickers. Digital stickers are super fun. I have over a thousand digital stickers saved! 


A downside:
* Learning to write on an iPad sucks. I highly recommend getting a palm rejection glove. My handwriting looked like a third-grader when I first got my iPad.",1620673832

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",TexasForever_,"From an old response to this question but -

“I would highly recommend it. I got one my second year of college and haven’t looked back. I honestly forget what it’s like to take notes on physical paper. It’s super convenient having all your searchable notes, pdf textbooks, lecture slides, and multiple colored pens and highlighters of all different sizes all in one tiny place. I’ve compared some of my notes since getting my iPad to before and it’s night and day in terms of readability and structure. It’s kind of weird to say but digital note taking makes taking notes “fun”. I could go on forever about all the benefits but there are a few cons.
From my experience, I’ve encountered a very small amount of things that made me say “ugh” since the switch. With everything technology, there will be occasional issues and bugs (e.g. documents disappearing, random spazzes when writing with the Apple Pencil, etc), but these have happened to me maybe a handful of times. Plus, there are plenty of ways to mitigate the damages of these bugs.
I’ve motivated like 4-5 of my friends to switch to digital note taking and they’ve enjoyed the switch. One of my friends has atrocious handwriting and him switching helped him create more readable notes to reference later. Just remember it works for some people better than others. I know people who’d rather take paper notes because the feel and it helps them retain information better. If you have an Apple Store near you or a friend who has an iPad, give it a try. Copy some of your handwritten notes over on the iPad and see what you think. Try to improve them in the process to get a feel of ways it might help make your notes better. Good luck!”",1620681519

It’s saved so much time with organising notes and makes it easier to study because you don’t see the massive pile of notes and papers on your desk. I initially was worried about missing paper and stationary and all that but taking notes on the iPad and reading is so much more convenient especially if you like to study in libraries or coffee shops. You can also make them really pretty and nice if you enjoy that. It will save you so much time especially because in university the information they give you is just all over the place and they love giving lots of slides and handouts so I definitely recommend using an iPad to make it more convenient and easy.

I don't really get your first point... I know some of my windows/android using friends like really hate apple for... Well everything. I gotta admit, i was one of them a few years back but that has changed.

Today i am a mess when i comes to operating systems:

I use an android phone, the big IPadPro, a windows pc, a windows/linux laptop and a Linux server (like no graphical interface). I still didn't get to like macos very much but that's just because i love to tinker with stuff so having a mac kinda limits me in unnecessary ways (probably there are workarounds n stuff, but i like the way my machine works) plus i also game some time so gaming on a mac was never the best experience... I just use things the way i like to work with them,who knows, maybe soon i will have a macbook because of THE ONE THING, but maybe i won't :D

But i totally get why people use them, don't get me wrong. Especially the new imac models are just *pheew that's hot*... While talking about ""digital note-taking i mostly refer to writing with the apple pencil, after reading my comment again, i kinda mixed things around when talking about that. Digital notes are still digital if you type them, obviously.

Also i wanna thank you for the idea of highlighting in long texts on the ipad, so i would have to optimize my questions:

1) get a digital copy of the syllabus for the class (in the course shell, ask instructor, scan it, whatever)

3) Create a blank slide for any assignment where you feel you will need or be given more information about it at a later date (ex. a research paper would get a slide) and hyperlink it. 

4) create pdf from keynote slides, import it into goodnotes (a worthy $5 investment).

5) in the notebook, click on the topic and proceed to taking notes. you can also import any slides the instructor gives, take pics of slides, etc. right there.

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great!",hahsakhssinak,"It has been by far the most amazing experience for me

I had an iPad since March 2020, I bought the pencil this January 2021 and I thought that “no I need to write on paper so that I don’t lose the habit of writing on paper” (because all my exams for the next four years are subjective three hour long papers where I have to write pages and pages of answers)

And then I got curious and I started using Apple Notes

I organised everything year wise and subject wise (I’m now in the second year)

And I really liked it

I only had to carry this one device to the lecture hall

And I could use split view to read textbook PDFs in iBooks

And then I discovered GoodNotes

Yeah Apple Notes is amazing

But goodnotes just simply blew my mind away

To be honest I don’t really spend on Apps because I think if I don’t use them then I’ll waste the money
(Except Apple Music and Netflix haha)

So then I watched [this](https://youtu.be/83RhJEyzCKc) video that compared Apple Notes to GoodNotes and then I thought why not give it a try

And then I bought it in March 2021

And when I started using it, I couldn’t even imagine all the things this app could do! It can do SO MUCH (some might think that it’s normal, but for me, a newbie, I was, and still am in awe of this app)

Plus my notes are much neater and more enhanced as I can add and delete stuff later on, and also I have endless colours and images and stickers to make them look appealing and functional at the same time

I cannot simply come to terms with the fact that all I have to study is in one device, that is with me wherever I am

And because of this pandemic and how it has affected my country (India), I had to constantly move from my hostel in my medical college to my home and back because of the varying restrictions

And I couldn’t be more than grateful

And of course there is iCloud, so everything is still safe even if something happens to my device (god forbid)

Also there are many video lectures that I watch, so I can just use split view and write away (again, just one device)

So now I have realised the importance of digital note taking

And I can only imagine the stacks of physical notebooks and tons of binders I would’ve collected over the years, trying to search for one small important lecture that a teacher had taken 4 years ago

Okay this is too long, but hey thanks for asking for personal experiences with digital note taking, because I’m honestly proud of myself for doing this🙈

Oh and you can watch [this](https://youtu.be/wW4QcHaeubk) video from Kharma Medic too if you haven’t already!

I bought a used iPad Pro 11"" May 2020 because I was tired of printing 8-15 page assignments/tests to write in the answers, scan them back in, and email to the instructor. He HAD to have hand written answers, would not accept typed. I talked to a tech/nerd friend of mine for help and he suggested iPad Pro with 2nd Gen pen. I was worried about spending the money but oh my goodness I have ZERO regrets. 

In addition to it making college more efficient, it makes my life in general more efficient. 

This is a small list of what I use Goodnotes for daily:   
Planner/Calendar  
Notebooks for life stuff  
Business notes for the business I am starting   
Scans of certificates, etc. essential for my business operations  
I download PDF books from z-lib and read them in GN - then I can highlight, write notes, etc.   
I download my college text books from z-lib (free BTW) and take notes, etc during class.   
PDF instructions for sewing patterns  
Sewing pattern file notes  
I had created a hyperlinked notebook for a surgery I had in 2020 that I was able to export as a PDF to my surgeon   
Scan word search pages into the app for something to do on the go that isn't social media linked LOL 

My daughter has an iPad Air and she was taking notes for a big test in her FFA class and worried she would not have enough information. I had her download GN and showed her how to import pictures, write, change text, etc. and she was able to create an entire sheet of near perfect notes that her teacher allowed her to use in class and he was blown away by it. Even asked if he could have a copy to share with the others. 

The possibilities really are endless. I am currently setting up another iPad for a friend who is a contractor. He lives out of notebooks and sticky notes and it is a complete disaster. So I am setting him up to transition to the digital world to make his life more efficient and his business more professional/productive.

Loved it. For my purposes, I took a lot of engineering courses which are not worth trying to type notes for - plus there were a LOT of diagrams. 


I also have a back/shoulder injury, so I try my best to carry a light load. Currently I teach said engineering courses, so I have an iPad Pro for giving notes and marking up drawings. I can share my screen and it's much more comfortable for me than writing on a whiteboard for long periods of time. I also refuse to accept hard copy drawing submissions for my drafting courses. It's much easier to mark them up in a pdf and send them back to my students, and it prevents me from carrying 100 11x17 drawing packages (and saves my students $$$).


I like being able to move things around, and create space for additional ideas that fit in with something I've written previously.

nd08zz,1,How is your experience with Goodnotes document scanning (using camera) &amp; Flashcard features?,," 

Basically I solved over 60 question papers. Many questions were easy. But some are either new conceots or too much to memorize. So I want to compile all those questions topic wise into flashcards on my iPad, so that I can do spaced repetition.

The thing is the question papers are hard copies and I used blue and red pens to scribble additional information near the questions. So while making flashcards, I don't want to rewrite using apple pen or type on a keyboard. It will be a waste of time.

Can Goodnote be useful?",Fatguyinagorillasuit,"Absolutely. I take photos and add them to my flash cards. Many of my answers come in detailed diagrams and photos.

nkvhjz,1,Outline Shortcut?,,[deleted],Designer-Strength159,"Did AA at West Point 2 years ago. It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

For example copying and pasting long alphanumeric passcodes from Lastpass into Goodnotes directly?,Designer-Strength159,"Did AA at West Point 2 years ago. It was like 11 days or so? 

There will be a timed layout early on. Make sure you bring everything and organize everything the way it should be. You will be given a paper on how everything should look like before then. I practiced the night before just to be safe. Seen lots of people get dropped for stupid stuff like forgetting a pen and stuff like that. Don't be that guy/girl.

There are some things you need to have on you at all times.. During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?

There will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  

 I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea. Before the obstacle courses you will do a 2 mile run in boots. The cut off time is like 18min? I witnessed like 10 people fail. I got second hand embarrassment from that so please don't fail....

There are major obstacles and minor obstacles. Failing 2 minors you will be dropped? Failing a major one will get you a drop. If you functionally are fit, these obstacle courses are pretty easy imo. Be good at climbing a rope, do some pullups, commit to whatever you're doing, and you'll be fine. 
Confidence climb can make tricky if youre short. You should be able to climb up easily, but the last 2-3 bars are spaced out farther than the others. If youre not afraid of heights take your time. Ive seen a short girl spend like 15 mins at the very top, figuring out how to get down and she eventually got it. There will be a line of people probably looking at you in case that worries you. I haven't seen anyone not get it so you'll be fine!

The really only hard part are the sling load inspections. Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this. I practiced probably a total of like 5-6 hours to memorize my sequence for reference.

After that there is the repelling part. A hand signal test. And I cant remember from here. Honestly wouldnt worry at all aside from the layout and sling loads. 
 You'll finish the course with a 12 mile ruck (25 lbs) and I think a final layout. Course is relatively flat, but there is a steep incline for a short part of it. 

Dont stress too much. There will be a lot of free time. I was on Netflix for like half the day lol. Barracks may or may not be disgusting, depends on if you've had a good life or not. 

I am a cadet at WP so obviously I had a huge advantage going in, but come fit and focused and youll be good to go.

Lemme know if you got any questions.",1622871499

The second link is the AMA rescinding their advice that it’s harmful, not stating that it’s proven to be helpful. 

The third link is actually quite informative. 
So it’s generally not a useful drug but if used in early stages may have some benefit. 
Thanks for sharing!

So not the panacea it’s been touted as but may be one more quiver in the arrow.",1622871499

noi3jd,1,Custom Templates Not Syncing,,"Custom templates I create and import to GoodNotes on my iPad do not sync to my iPhone and iMac.

Have already tried all the common solutions, nothing fixes the issue. I submitted a very detailed support request to GoodNotes, but thought I would ask here if anyone else is experiencing this?

All documents and custom elements are in sync across all devices.

Any ideas?",roakmi,"Received a reply from GoodNotes earlier today. Seems it was my error, I did not select the correct paper size and color to match my templates, that's why they did not show up. A stupid mistake, but something to check if you can't find all your templates on other devices.",1622435860
