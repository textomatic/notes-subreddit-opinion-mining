Am I the only one who’s feeling this way?\\n\\nI’m not sure exactly what is wrong but I think it might be because there is too much variation in stroke thickness with pressure. I don’t want to completely disable the effects of pressure, but right now, the current fountain pen is just horrible. I always used the 1.9 unit thickness in Goodnotes 4, but in Goodnotes 5 the units of thickness has changed and I can not find a thickness that is equivalent to the old pen (maybe between the new 0.3 and 0.4 mm). \\n\\nCould we please have the option to revert to the old inking behaviour? :( for once I am glad that they released a completely new app because I can still use Goodnotes 4, but I have been waiting so long for vertical scrolling.    \n",
       "21  I just got Goodnotes 5 and I was so excited for vertical scrolling only to be completely disappointed by the inking behaviour. I had previously switched from Notability because I didn’t like their inking behaviour... and now the pen in Goodnotes 5 feels just like Notability’s.

The app store description for GoodNotes 5  says \"Use one of many supported styluses (Apple Pencil included) or your finger to write like on real paper,\" which I had interpreted to mean that there would be support for the same range of third-party styluses as on GoodNotes 4. \\n\\nHas anyone managed to get GoodNotes 5 working with other styluses yet? Please let me know if I'm overlooking something!   \n",

       "      <td>Hi there\\n\\nI have had GN5 installed on my iPad for a while now, and have come across some things that could be improved\\n\\n1) The app seems kind of slow and laggy when scrolling through documents, especially if there is a fair bit written on a page\\n\\n2) Writing occasionally disappears and then reappears\\n\\n3) The colour code doesn't show the one of the colour currently selected. It always shows FFEEFF\\n\\n4) Squared paper isn't sized how it should be compared to actual paper. On real paper you have squares that are 5mm wide and tall. The closest I have seen is the \"squared paper\" template, with 5,75mm intervals\\n\\n5) Pen sizes in GN4 and GN5 use different systems. A \"1\" in GN4 is approximately a \"0,2mm\" in GN5, while a text marker \"10\" in GN4 is a \"2mm\" in GN5. Am i correct in assuming a 1=0.2 ratio?\\n\\nI would be happy if someone were to look at these things and appreciate any response. Thank you.</td>\n",

The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. \\n\\n2) I will try to recreate that. \\n\\n3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code 123456. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me #123456 but #FFEEFF\\n\\n4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.\\n\\n5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals.

A \"1\" in GN4 is approximately a \"0,2mm\" in GN5, while a text marker \"10\" in GN4 is a \"2mm\" in GN5. Am i correct in assuming a 1=0.2 ratio?\\n\\nI would be happy if someone were to look at these things and appreciate any response. Thank you.   \n",

It is just so much better and so much easier than GoodNotes. I do hope that the developers might see this and hopefully implemenet but honeslty I would switch in a heartbeat   \n",

       "660   1) I am using a 10.5 inch iPad Pro with everything updated to the current version, so I shouldn't have any issues regarding performance either. The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. \\n\\n2) I will try to recreate that. \\n\\n3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code 123456. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me #123456 but #FFEEFF\\n\\n4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.\\n\\n5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals. In GN5 you go from 0.1mm to 2mm in 0.05mm intervals.   \n",

       "660   1) I am using a 10.5 inch iPad Pro with everything updated to the current version, so I shouldn't have any issues regarding performance either. The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. \\n\\n2) I will try to recreate that. \\n\\n3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code 123456. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me #123456 but #FFEEFF\\n\\n4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.\\n\\n5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals. In GN5 you go from 0.1mm to 2mm in 0.05mm intervals.   \n",

       "660   1) I am using a 10.5 inch iPad Pro with everything updated to the current version, so I shouldn't have any issues regarding performance either. The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. \\n\\n2) I will try to recreate that. \\n\\n3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code 123456. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me #123456 but #FFEEFF\\n\\n4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.\\n\\n5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals. In GN5 you go from 0.1mm to 2mm in 0.05mm intervals.  \n",

The blank pages happen to me as well, but sometimes when turning the page the app hangs for a bit before it fully changes to the next page. \\n\\n2) I will try to recreate that. \\n\\n3) Lets say I create a colour preset with the hex code. When initially creating it, it shows me the correct code. But if I then want to change the colour it doesn't show me but\\n\\n4) I didn't know that. But even then, If I use a small pen zoomed out it appears larger when zooming in. So shouldn't it be possible to create paper with 5mm intervals that stay at 5mm? If I use a marker with a with of 5mm it should always completely fill out a square, whether zommed in or not. After all that's how pens behave as well.\\n\\n5) In GN4, you don't have a unit when changing the pen size. You go from 0.5 to 10 in 0.1 step intervals. In GN5 you go from 0.1mm to 2mm in 0.05mm intervals.\""
